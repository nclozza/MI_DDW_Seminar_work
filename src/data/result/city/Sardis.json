Sardis was the capital of the ancient kingdom of Lydia,[1] one of the important cities of the Persian Empire, the seat of a Seleucid Satrap, the seat of a proconsul under the Roman Empire, and the metropolis of the province Lydia in later Roman and Byzantine times. As one of the seven churches of Asia, it was addressed by John, the author of the Book of Revelation in the New Testament,[2] in terms which seem to imply that its church members did not finish what they started, that they were about image and not substance.[3] Its importance was due first to its military strength, secondly to its situation on an important highway leading from the interior to the Aegean coast, and thirdly to its commanding the wide and fertile plain of the Hermus.\n\nGeography\nSardis was situated in the middle of Hermus valley, at the foot of Mount Tmolus, a steep and lofty spur which formed the citadel. It was about 4 kilometres (2.5\u00a0mi) south of the Hermus. Today, the site is located by the present day village of Sart, near Salihli in the Manisa province of Turkey, close to the Ankara - \u0130zmir highway (approximately 72 kilometres (45\u00a0mi) from \u0130zmir). The part of remains including the bath-gymnasium complex, synagogue and Byzantine shops is open to visitors year-round.\n\nFoundation stories\nThe Greek historian and father of history, Herodotus, notes that the city was founded by the sons of Hercules, the Heraclides. According to Herodotus, the Heraclides ruled for five hundred and five years beginning with Agron, 1220 BC, and ending with Candaules, 716 BC. They were followed by the Mermnades, which began with Gyges, 716 BC, and ended with Croesus, 546 BC.{\"citetype\": \"journal\", \"year\": \"1844\", \"title\": \"On the Lydian Dynasty which preceded the Mermnad\\u00e6\", \"url\": \"https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3917311;view=1up;seq=306\", \"journal\": \"Proceedings of the Philological Society\", \"volume\": \"1\", \"pages\": \"274\", \"author\": \"Cockayne, O.\", \"number\": \"24\"} The earliest reference to Sardis is in The Persians of Aeschylus (472\u00a0BC); in the Iliad, the name \u201cHyde\u201d seems to be given to the city of the Maeonian (i.e. Lydian) chiefs and in later times Hyde was said to be the older name of Sardis, or the name of its citadel. \nIt is, however, more probable that Sardis was not the original capital of the Maeonians, but that it became so amid the changes which produced the powerful Lydian empire of the 8th\u00a0century\u00a0BC.\n\nTarget of conquest\nThe city was captured by the Cimmerians in the 7th\u00a0century\u00a0BC, by the Persians in the 6th, by the Athenians in the 5th, and by Antiochus III the Great at the end of the 3rd\u00a0century\u00a0BC.\nIn the Persian era, Sardis was conquered by Cyrus the Great and formed the end station for the Persian Royal Road which began in Persepolis, capital of Persia. Sardis was the site of the most important Persian satrapy.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"1983\", \"chapter\": \"Iranians in Asia Minor\", \"title\": \"The Cambridge History of Iran, Vol. 3 (1): The Seleucid, Parthian and Sasanian periods\", \"publisher\": \"Cambridge University Press\", \"isbn\": \"978-1139054942\", \"ref\": \"harv\", \"last\": \"Raditsa\", \"first\": \"Leo\", \"editorgiven1 \": \"Ehsan\", \"editorsurname1 \": \"Yarshater\", \"postscript \": \".\"}\nDuring the Ionian Revolt, the Athenians burnt down the city. Sardis remained under Persian domination until it surrendered to Alexander the Great in 334\u00a0BC.\n\nReliable gold coins\nThe early Lydian kingdom was very advanced in the industrial arts and Sardis was the chief seat of its manufactures. The most important of these trades was the manufacture and dyeing of delicate woolen stuffs and carpets. The stream Pactolus which flowed through the market-place \"carried golden sands\" in early antiquity, which was in reality gold dust out of Mount Tmolus. It was during the reign of King Croesus that the metallurgists of Sardis discovered the secret of separating gold from silver, thereby producing both metals of a purity never known before.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"last1\": \"Ramage\", \"first1\": \"A.\", \"last2\": \"Craddock\", \"first2\": \"P.\", \"year\": \"2001\", \"title\": \"Archaeological Exploration of Sardis\", \"article\": \"King Croesus' Gold: Excavations at Sardis and the history of gold refining\"}\nThis was an economic revolution, for while gold nuggets panned or mined were used as currency, their purity was always suspect and a hindrance to trade. Such nuggets or coinage were naturally occurring alloys of gold and silver known as electrum and one could never know how much of it was gold and how much was silver. Sardis now could mint nearly pure silver and gold coins, the value of which could be \u2013 and was \u2013 trusted throughout the known world. This revolution made Sardis rich and Croesus' name synonymous with wealth itself. For this reason, Sardis is famed in history as the place where modern currency was invented.\n\nDesolation in 17\u00a0AD earthquake\nDisaster came to the great city under the reign of the emperor Tiberius, when in 17\u00a0AD, Sardis was destroyed by an earthquake, but it was rebuilt with the help of ten\u00a0million sesterces from the Emperor and exempted from paying taxes for five\u00a0years.[7] It was one of the great cities of western Asia Minor until the later Byzantine period.\nLater, trade and the organization of commerce continued to be sources of great wealth. After Constantinople became the capital of the East, a new road system grew up connecting the provinces with the capital. Sardis then lay rather apart from the great lines of communication and lost some of its importance. It still, however, retained its titular supremacy and continued to be the seat of the metropolitan bishop of the province of Lydia, formed in 295\u00a0AD. It was enumerated as third, after Ephesus and Smyrna, in the list of cities of the Thracesion thema given by Constantine Porphyrogenitus in the 10th\u00a0century. However, over the next four centuries it was in the shadow of the provinces of Magnesia-upon-Sipylum and Philadelphia, which retained their importance in the region.\n\nDecline and fall in the second millennium, AD\nAfter 1071, the Hermus valley began to suffer from the inroads of the Seljuk Turks but the Byzantine general John Doukas reconquered the city in 1097. The successes of the general Philokales in 1118 relieved the district from later Turkish pressure and the ability of the Comneni dynasty together with the gradual decay of the Seljuk Sultanate of Rum meant that it remained under Byzantine dominion. When Constantinople was taken by the Venetians and Franks in 1204 Sardis came under the rule of the Byzantine Empire of Nicea.\nHowever once the Byzantines retook Constantinople in 1261, Sardis with the entire Asia Minor was neglected and the region eventually fell under the control of Ghazi (Ghazw) emirs. The Cayster valleys and a fort on the citadel of Sardis was handed over to them by treaty in 1306. The city continued its decline until its capture (and probable destruction) by the Turco-Mongol warlord Timur in 1402.\n\nArchaeological expeditions\nCurrent laws governing archaeological expeditions in Turkey ensure that all artifacts remain in Turkey. Some of the important finds from the site of Sardis are housed in the Archaeological Museum of Manisa, including Late Roman mosaics and sculpture, a helmet from the mid-6th\u00a0century\u00a0BCE, and pottery from various periods.\n\nRoman antiquities\nBy the 19th\u00a0century, Sardis was in ruins, showing construction chiefly of the Roman period. Early excavators included the British explorer George Dennis, who uncovered an enormous marble head of Faustina the Elder, wife of the Roman Emperor Antoninus Pius. Found in the precinct of the Temple of Artemis, it probably formed part of a pair of colossal statues devoted to the Imperial couple. The 1.76\u00a0metre high head is now kept at the British Museum.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=459896&partId=1&place=34488&plaA=34488-3-1&page=1\", \"title\": \"Research collection online\", \"publisher\": \"British Museum\"}\nThe first large-scale archaeological expedition in Sardis was directed by a Princeton University team led by Howard Crosby Butler between years 1910\u20131914, unearthing a temple to Artemis, and more than a thousand Lydian tombs. The excavation campaign was halted by World War I, followed by the Turkish War of Independence, though it briefly resumed in 1922. Some surviving artifacts from the Butler excavation were added to the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.\n\nSardis synagogue\nThe Hebrew place-name Sepharad may have meant Sardis.\nA new expedition known as the Archaeological Exploration of Sardis was founded in 1958 by G.M.A. Hanfmann, professor in the Department of Fine Arts at Harvard University, and by Henry Detweiler, dean of the Architecture School at Cornell University. Hanfmann excavated widely in the city and the region, excavating and restoring the major Roman bath-gymnasium complex, the synagogue, late Roman houses and shops, a Lydian industrial area for processing electrum into pure gold and silver, Lydian occupation areas, and tumulus tombs at Bin Tepe.[9]\nFrom 1976 until 2007, the excavation was directed by Crawford H. Greenewalt, Jr., professor in the Department of Classics at the University of California, Berkeley.[10] Since 2008, the excavation has been under the directorship of Nicholas Cahill, professor at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.harvardartmuseums.org/study-research/research-centers/sardis\", \"title\": \"Archaeological Exploration of Sardis, Harvard Art Museums\", \"accessdate\": \"January 9, 2013\"}\nSince 1958, both Harvard and Cornell Universities have sponsored annual archeological expeditions to Sardis. These excavations unearthed perhaps the most impressive synagogue in the western diaspora yet discovered from antiquity, yielding over eighty Greek and seven Hebrew inscriptions as well as numerous mosaic floors. (For evidence in the east, see Dura Europos in Syria.) The discovery of the Sardis synagogue has reversed previous assumptions about Judaism in the later Roman empire. Along with the discovery of the godfearers / theosebeis inscription from Aphrodisias, it provides indisputable evidence for the continued presence of Jewish communities in Asia Minor and their integration into general Roman life at a time when many scholars previously assumed that Christianity had eclipsed Judaism.[citation needed]\nThe synagogue was a section of a large bath-gymnasium complex, that was in use for about 450\u2013500\u00a0years. In the late 4th or 5th century, part of the bath-gymnasium complex was changed into a synagogue.\n",
