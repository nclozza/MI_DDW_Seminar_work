The name first applied to the bay but, following an expedition by Alexey Shefner in 1860, was applied to the new settlement.[14]\nIn Chinese, the place where the city is situated nowadays has been known since the Qing dynasty as Haishenwai (\u6d77\u53c3\u5d34, H\u01ceish\u0113nw\u01cei), from the Manchu Hai\u0161enwai (Manchu: \u1865\u1820\u1873\u1867\u185d\u1828\u1838\u185d\u1873;\u2002M\u00f6llendorff: Hai\u0161enwai;\u2002Abkai: Haixenwai) or \"small seaside village\".{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.radiotj.com/pdfc/system/2009/12/03/000216884.shtml\", \"title\": \"\\u51b0\\u96ea\\u9ed1\\u9f99\\u6c5f \\u5723\\u8bde\\u5f02\\u56fd\\u6e38--\\u9891\\u9053\\u98ce\\u91c7\", \"website\": \"\\u5929\\u6d25\\u5e7f\\u64ad\\u7f51\", \"publisher\": \"\\u5929\\u6d25\\u4eba\\u6c11\\u5e7f\\u64ad\\u7535\\u53f0\\u4ea4\\u901a\\u5e7f\\u64ad\", \"accessdate\": \"9 February 2018\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20170910174047/http://www.radiotj.com/pdfc/system/2009/12/03/000216884.shtml\", \"archivedate\": \"September 10, 2017\", \"last1\": \"\\u9633\", \"first1\": \"\\u66f9\"}\nIn modern-day China, Vladivostok is officially known by the transliteration \u7b26\u62c9\u8fea\u6c83\u65af\u6258\u514b (F\u00fal\u0101d\u00edw\u00f2s\u012btu\u014dk\u00e8), although the historical Chinese name \u6d77\u53c2\u5d34 (H\u01ceish\u0113nw\u01cei) is still often used in common parlance and outside mainland China to refer to the city.[16][17] According to the provisions of the Chinese government, all maps published in China have to bracket the city's Chinese name.[18]\nThe modern-day Japanese name of the city is transliterated as Urajiosutoku (\u30a6\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u30b9\u30c8\u30af).

The region had been at least nominally part of many states, such as the Mohe, Balhae Kingdom, Liao Dynasty, J\u012bn Dynasty, Yuan Dynasty, Ming Dynasty, Qing Dynasty and various other Asian dynasties, before Russia acquired Primorsky Krai and the island of Sakhalin by the Treaty of Beijing (1860). Qing China, which had just lost the Opium War with Britain, was unable to defend the region. The Manchu emperors of China, the Qing Dynasty, banned Han Chinese from most of Manchuria including the Vladivostok area (see Willow Palisade)\u2014it was only visited by illegal gatherers of ginseng and sea cucumbers.\nOn 20 June 1860 (2 July for Gregorian style), the military supply ship Manchur, under the command of Captain-Lieutenant Alexey K. Shefner, called at the Golden Horn Bay to found an outpost called Vladivostok. Warrant officer Nikolay Komarov, with 28 soldiers and two non-commissioned officers under his command, were brought from Nikolayevsk-on-Amur by ship to construct the first buildings of the future city.\nThe Manza War in 1868 was the first attempt by Russia to expel the Chinese inhabitants from  territory it controlled. Hostilities broke out around Vladivostok when the Russians tried to shut off gold mining operations and expel Chinese workers there.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"2005\", \"title\": \"China inside out: contemporary Chinese nationalism and transnationalism\", \"url\": \"https://books.google.com/books?id=icZJJN0wYPcC&pg=PA89#v=onepage&q&f=false\", \"edition\": \"illustrated\", \"publisher\": \"Central European University Press\", \"isbn\": \"963-7326-14-6\", \"accessdate\": \"18 March 2012\", \"quote\": \"Probably the first clash between the Russians and Chinese occurred in 1868.

A telegraph line from Vladivostok to Shanghai and Nagasaki was opened in 1871.  That same year a commercial port was relocated to Vladivostok from Nikolayevsk-on-Amur. Town status was granted on 22 April 1880. A coat of arms, representing the Siberian tiger, was adopted in March 1883.\nThe first high school was opened in 1899.

Vladivostok then became the capital of the Japanese-backed Provisional Priamurye Government, created after a White Army coup in the city in May 1921. The withdrawal of Japanese forces in October 1922 spelt the end of the enclave, with the Red Army under Ieronim Uborevich taking the city on 25 October 1922.\nAs the main naval base of the Soviet Pacific Fleet, Vladivostok was officially closed to foreigners during the Soviet years. The city hosted the summit at which Leonid Brezhnev and Gerald Ford conducted the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks in 1974. At the time, the two countries decided quantitative limits on nuclear weapons systems and banned the construction of new land-based ICBM launchers.\nIn 2012, Vladivostok hosted the 24th APEC summit. Leaders from the APEC member countries met at Russky Island, off the coast of Vladivostok.[26] With the summit on Russky Island, the government and private businesses inaugurated resorts, dinner and entertainment facilities, in addition to the renovation and upgrading of Vladivostok International Airport.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"31 January 2007\", \"title\": \"Putin proposes Russky Island venue for APEC-2012\", \"url\": \"http://vn.vladnews.ru/issue554/Special_reports/Putin_proposes_Russky_Island_venue_for_APEC2012\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"location\": \"Vladivostok\", \"publisher\": \"[[Vladivostok News]]\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20090215210519/http://vn.vladnews.ru/issue554/Special_reports/Putin_proposes_Russky_Island_venue_for_APEC2012\", \"archivedate\": \"February 15, 2009\", \"accessdate\": \"2009-02-11\"} Two giant cable-stayed bridges were built in preparation for the summit, the Zolotoy Rog bridge over the Zolotoy Rog Bay in the center of the city, and the Russky Island Bridge from the mainland to Russky Island (the longest cable-stayed bridge in the world).

Eagle's Nest Hill is often called the highest point of the city; but, with a height of only 199 meters (653\u00a0ft), or 214 meters (702\u00a0ft) according to other sources, it is the highest point of the downtown area, but not of the whole city.\nLocated in the extreme South East of Asian Russia, Vladivostok is geographically closer to Anchorage, Alaska and even Darwin, Australia than it is to the nation's capital of Moscow. Vladivostok is also closer to Honolulu, Hawaii than to the western Russian city of Sochi.\n\nClimate\nVladivostok has a monsoon-influenced humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Dwb) with warm, humid and rainy summers and cold, dry winters. Owing to the influence of the Siberian High, winters are far colder than a latitude of 43 degrees north should warrant given its low elevation and coastal location, with a January average of \u221212.3\u00a0\u00b0C (9.9\u00a0\u00b0F). Since the maritime influence is strong in summer, Vladivostok has a relatively cold annual climate for its latitude. Vladivostok's yearly mean of around 5\u00a0\u00b0C (41\u00a0\u00b0F) is some ten degrees lower than in cities on the French Riviera on a similar coastal latitude on the other side of Eurasia. Winters in particular are around 20\u00a0\u00b0C (36\u00a0\u00b0F) colder than on the mildest coastlines this far north, and are considerably colder than locations on the North American east coast at similar latitudes such as Halifax, Nova Scotia and Portland, Maine.\nIn winter, temperatures can drop below \u221220\u00a0\u00b0C (\u22124\u00a0\u00b0F) while mild spells of weather can raise daytime temperatures above freezing. The average monthly precipitation, mainly in the form of snow, is around 18.5 millimeters (0.73\u00a0in) from December to March. Snow is common during winter, but individual snowfalls are light, with a maximum snow depth of only 5 centimeters (2.0\u00a0in) in January. During winter, clear sunny days are common.\nSummers are warm, humid and rainy, due to the East Asian monsoon. The warmest month is August, with an average temperature of +19.8\u00a0\u00b0C (67.6\u00a0\u00b0F). Vladivostok receives most of its precipitation during the summer months, and most summer days see some rainfall. Cloudy days are fairly common and because of the frequent rainfall, humidity is high, on average about 90% from June to August.\nOn average, Vladivostok receives 840 millimeters (33\u00a0in) per year, but the driest year was 1943, when 418 millimeters (16.5\u00a0in) of precipitation fell, and the wettest was 1974, with 1,272 millimeters (50.1\u00a0in) of precipitation. The winter months from December to March are dry, and in some years they have seen no measurable precipitation at all. Extremes range from \u221231.4\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221224.5\u00a0\u00b0F) in January 1931 to +33.6\u00a0\u00b0C (92.5\u00a0\u00b0F) in July 1939.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.pogodaiklimat.ru/climate/31960.htm\", \"website\": \"\\u041f\\u043e\\u0433\\u043e\\u0434\\u0430 \\u0438 \\u041a\\u043b\\u0438\\u043c\\u0430\\u0442 (Weather and Climate)\", \"scripttitle\": \"ru:\\u041a\\u043b\\u0438\\u043c\\u0430\\u0442 \\u0412\\u043b\\u0430\\u0434\\u0438\\u0432\\u043e\\u0441\\u0442\\u043e\\u043a\\u0430\", \"transtitle\": \"Climate of Vladivostok\", \"accessdate\": \"June 19, 2013\"}\n\n\nPolitics\nHead of the city of Vladivostok on the principles of unity of command directs the administration of the city of Vladivostok in accordance with federal laws, the laws of the Primorsky Krai, and the charter of the city. The structure of the city administration has the City Council at the top.\nThe responsibilities of the administration of Vladivostok are:\nLegislative authority is vested in the City Council. The new City Council began operations in 2001 and on 21 June, deputies of the Duma of the first convocation of Vladivostok began their work.

The deputies consist of 35 elected members, including 18 members chosen by a single constituency, and 17 deputies from single-mandate constituencies.\n\nAdministrative and municipal status\nVladivostok is the administrative centre of the krai. Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is, together with five rural localities, incorporated as Vladivostok City Under Krai Jurisdiction\u2014an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts.[1] As a municipal division, Vladivostok City Under Krai Jurisdiction is incorporated as Vladivostoksky Urban Okrug.[7]\n\nDemographics\nThe population of the city, according to the 2010 Census, is 592,034,[33] down from 594,701 recorded in the 2002 Census.[13] This is further down from 633,838 recorded in the 1989 Census.[34] Following the 2009 recession the population of the city has continuously increased to 606,653 as of 2016[update][35] Ethnic Russians make up the majority of the population.\n\nEconomy\nThe city's main industries are shipping, commercial fishing, and the naval base. Fishing accounts for almost four-fifths of Vladivostok's commercial production. Other food production totals 11%.\nA very important employer and a major source of revenue for the city's inhabitants is the import of Japanese cars.{\"citetype\": \"journal\", \"date\": \"2010-07-12\", \"title\": \"Putin Is Turning Vladivostok into Russia's Pacific Capital\", \"url\": \"http://kms1.isn.ethz.ch/serviceengine/Files/ISN/118673/ipublicationdocument_singledocument/56406c10-2faa-4bb1-98dd-189045b0b62b/en/Russian_Analytical_Digest_82.pdf\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"journal\": \"Russia Analytical Digest\", \"publisher\": \"Institute of History, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland\", \"issue\": \"82\", \"pages\": \"9\\u201312\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20110706230818/http://kms1.isn.ethz.ch/serviceengine/Files/ISN/118673/ipublicationdocument_singledocument/56406c10-2faa-4bb1-98dd-189045b0b62b/en/Russian_Analytical_Digest_82.pdf\", \"archivedate\": \"July 6, 2011\"} Besides salesmen, the industry employs repairmen, fitters, import clerks as well as shipping and railway companies.{\"citetype\": \"journal\", \"last1\": \"Oliphant\", \"first1\": \"Roland\", \"title\": \"Ruler of the East: The City of Vladivostok Is a Mixture of Promise and Neglect\", \"journal\": \"[[Russia Profile]]\"} The Vladivostok dealers sell 250,000 cars a year, with 200,000 going to other parts of Russia.{\"citetype\": \"journal\", \"last1\": \"Oliphant\", \"first1\": \"Roland\", \"title\": \"Ruler of the East: The City of Vladivostok Is a Mixture of Promise and Neglect\", \"journal\": \"[[Russia Profile]]\"} Every third worker in the Primorsky Krai has some relation to the automobile import business.

Finished in 1905, the rail line ran from Moscow to Vladivostok via several of Russia's main cities. Part of the railroad, known as the Chinese Eastern Line, crossed over into China, passing through Harbin, a major city in Manchuria. Today, Vladivostok serves as the main starting point for the Trans-Siberian portion of the Eurasian Land Bridge.Vladivostok is the main air hub in the Russian Far East. Vladivostok International Airport (VVO) is the home base of Aurora airline - a Russian Far East air carrier, a subsidiary of Aeroflot. The airline was formed by Aeroflot in 2013 by amalgamating SAT Airlines and Vladivostok Avia. The Vladivostok International Airport was significantly upgraded in 2013 with a new 3500-metre runway capable of accommodating all aircraft types without any restrictions. The Terminal A was built in 2012 with a capacity of 3.5 million passengers per year.\nInternational flights connect Vladivostok with\nJapan, China, Philippines and Vietnam.\n\nIt is possible to get to Vladivostok from several of the larger cities in Russia. Regular flights to Seattle, Washington, were available in the 1990s but have been cancelled since. Vladivostok Air was flying to Anchorage, Alaska, from July 2008 to 2013, before its transformation into Aurora airline.Vladivostok is the starting point of Ussuri Highway (M60) to Khabarovsk, the easternmost part of Trans-Siberian Highway that goes all the way to Moscow and Saint Petersburg via Novosibirsk.  The other main highways go east to Nakhodka and south to Khasan.\n\nUrban transportation\nOn 28 June 1908, Vladivostok's first tram line was started along Svetlanskaya Street, running from the railway station on Lugovaya Street.[citation needed]  On 9 October 1912, the first wooden cars manufactured in Belgium entered service. Today, Vladivostok's means of public transportation include trolleybus, bus, tram, train, funicular, and ferryboat. The main urban traffic lines are City Centre\u2014Vtoraya Rechka, City Centre\u2014Pervaya Rechka\u20143ya Rabochaya\u2014Balyayeva, and City Centre\u2014Lugovaya Street.\nCars of the Vladivostok funicular\nBuses in Vladivostok\nTrams in Vladivostok\nIn 2012, Vladivostok hosted the 24th Summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum. In preparation for the event, the infrastructure of the city was renovated and improved. Two giant cable-stayed bridges were constructed in Vladivostok, namely the Zolotoy Rog Bridge over the Golden Horn Bay in the centre of the city, and the Russky Bridge from the mainland to Russky Island, where the summit took place. The latter bridge is the longest cable-stayed bridge in the world.\n\nPort\nThe port is ice-free all year round (with the help of ice breakers), and in 2002 had a foreign trade turnover worth $275 million.[38] In 2015, a special economic zone has been settled with the free port of Vladivostok.\n\nEducation\nVladivostok is home to numerous educational institutions, including five universities:\nThe Presidium of the Far Eastern Division of the Russian Academy of Sciences (\u0414\u0412\u041e \u0420\u0410\u041d) as well as ten of its research institutes are also located in Vladivostok, as is the Pacific Research Institute of Fisheries and Oceanography (\u0422\u0438\u0445\u043e\u043e\u043a\u0435\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043d\u0430\u0443\u0447\u043d\u043e-\u0438\u0441\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0440\u044b\u0431\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0437\u044f\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0440 or \u0422\u0418\u041d\u0420\u041e).\n\nMedia\nOver fifty newspapers and regional editions to Moscow publications are issued in Vladivostok. The largest newspaper of the Primorsky Krai and the whole Russian Far East is Vladivostok News with a circulation of 124,000 copies at the beginning of 1996. Its founder, joint-stock company Vladivostok-News, also issues a weekly English-language newspaper Vladivostok News.

Vladivostok has about eighty industrial sites, which may not be many compared to Russia's most industrialized areas, but those around the city are particularly environmentally unfriendly, such as shipbuilding and repairing, power stations, printing, fur farming, and mining.\nIn addition, Vladivostok has a particularly vulnerable geography which compounds the effect of pollution. Winds cannot clear pollution from some of the most densely populated areas around the Pervaya and Vtoraya Rechka as they sit in basins which the winds blow over. In addition, there is little snow in winter and no leaves or grass to catch the dust to make it settle down.[42]\n\nSports\nVladivostok is home to the football club FC Luch-Energiya Vladivostok, who plays in the Russian First Division, ice hockey club Admiral Vladivostok from the Kontinental Hockey League's Chernyshev Division, and basketball club Spartak Primorye, who plays in the Russian Basketball Super League.\n\nTwin towns - sister cities\nVladivostok is twinned with:{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.vlc.ru/city/tourism/Goroda-pobratimy\", \"title\": \"\\u0413\\u043e\\u0440\\u043e\\u0434\\u0430-\\u043f\\u043e\\u0431\\u0440\\u0430\\u0442\\u0438\\u043c\\u044b\", \"website\": \"vlc.ru\", \"publisher\": \"Vladivostok\", \"language\": \"ru\"}\nIn 2010, arches with the names of each of Vladivostok's twin towns were placed in a park within the city.[44]\nFrom Vladivostok ferry port next to the train station, a ferry of the DBS Cruise Ferry travels regularly to Donghae, South Korea and from there to Sakaiminato on the Japanese main island of Honshu.\n\nExternal links\n\n",
