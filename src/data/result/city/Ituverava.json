The population is 40,994 (2015 est.) in an area of 705 km\u00b2.[1]\n\nGeography\nIt is located in the north region of S\u00e3o Paulo state, at a distance of 410 km from the capital of S\u00e3o Paulo State, and with an altitude of 605 meters.\n\nEconomy\nThe economy is predominantly agricultural, based on the cultivation of sugar cane. As a micro region polo, it has a relative strong trade and advanced service sector mainly based on medicine services. \nThe industrial sector has changed a little during the last decades as the cotton and soybeans crops had gone to agricultural frontiers as Mato Grosso and Goias and the sugarcane reconfigured the north of  S\u00e3o Paulo. The agriculture raw material transfirmation industry that had gone with the soybeans and cotton crops (Maeda) gave place to some consumption and chemicals industries (Santa Maria, UPL). \n\nHistory\nThe town was founded in the beginning of the 19th century, and grew around a chapel dedicated to Our Lady of Mount Carmel (Nossa Senhora do Carmo). In 1847 it became a district of the municipality Franca, under the name Carmo de Franca. It became an independent municipality in 1885. In 1899 the name was changed to Ituverava, which is Tupi\u2013Guarani for \"shining waterfall\".[2]\n",
