It is the district capital of the Rafah Governorate, located 30 kilometers (19\u00a0mi) south of Gaza City. Rafah's population of 152,950 (2014) is overwhelmingly made up of Palestinian refugees. Rafah camp and Tall as-Sultan camp form separate localities.\nWhen Israel withdrew from the Sinai in 1982, Rafah was split into a Gazan part and an Egyptian part, dividing families, separated by barbed-wire barriers.[3]{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"url\": \"https://archive.org/details/PalestineCensus1922\", \"editor \": \"Barron, J. B.\", \"title \": \"Palestine: Report and General Abstracts of the Census of 1922\", \"publisher \": \"Government of Palestine\"} The core of the city was destroyed by Israel[5][6][7] and Egypt[8][9] to create a large buffer zone.\nRafah is the site of the Rafah Border Crossing, the sole crossing point between Egypt and the State of Palestine. Gaza's only airport, Yasser Arafat International Airport, was located just south of the city. The airport operated from 1998 to 2001, until it was bombed and bulldozed by the Israeli military (IDF) after the killing of Israeli soldiers by members of Hamas.\n\nEtymology\nOver the ages it has been known as \"Robihwa\" by the ancient Egyptians, \"Rafihu\" by the Assyrians, \"\u1fec\u03b1\u03c6\u03af\u03b1, Rhaphia\"[10] by the Greeks, \"Raphia\" by Romans, \u05e8\u05e4\u05d9\u05d7 \"Rafia\u1e25\" by the Israelites, \"Rafh\" by the Arab Caliphate. The transliteration of the Hebrew name, \"Rafiah\", is used in modern English alongside \"Rafah\"{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.geographic.org/geographic_names/name.php?uni=-1153519&fid=2245&c=gaza_strip\", \"title\": \"Raf\\u012bah: Gaza Strip; name, map, geographic coordinates\", \"publisher\": \"Geographic.org\"}{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"2007\", \"title\": \"Napoleon -The Path To Power 1769-1799\", \"publisher\": \"Bloomsbury\", \"last\": \"Dwyer\", \"first\": \"Philip\"}\n\nDevelopment\nThe Ottoman\u2013British agreement of 1 October 1906 established a boundary between Ottoman ruled Palestine and British ruled Egypt, from Taba to Rafah. After World War I Palestine was also under British control, but the Egypt-Palestine Boundary was maintained to control movement of the local Bedouin. From the mid-1930s the British enhanced the border control and Rafah evolved as a small boundary town which functioned as a trade and services centre for the semi-settled Beduin population.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"url\": \"https://archive.org/details/PalestineCensus1922\", \"editor \": \"Barron, J. B.\", \"title \": \"Palestine: Report and General Abstracts of the Census of 1922\", \"publisher \": \"Government of Palestine\"} During the Second World War it became an important British base.\nFollowing the Armistice Agreement of 24 February 1949, Rafah was located in Egypt-occupied Gaza and consequently, a Gaza\u2013Egypt border did no longer exist. Rafah could grow without any consideration being taken of the old 1906 international boundary.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"url\": \"https://archive.org/details/PalestineCensus1922\", \"editor \": \"Barron, J. B.\", \"title \": \"Palestine: Report and General Abstracts of the Census of 1922\", \"publisher \": \"Government of Palestine\"} In the 1967 Six-Day War, Israel conquered the Sinai Peninsula and the Gaza Strip from Egypt and all of the city now was under Israeli occupation.\nIn 1979, Israel and Egypt signed a peace treaty that returned the Sinai, which borders the Gaza Strip, to Egyptian control. In the Peace Treaty, the re-created Gaza\u2013Egypt border was drawn across the city of Rafah. Rafah was divided into an Egyptian and a Palestinian part, splitting up families, separated by barbed-wire barriers. Families were separated, property was divided and many houses and orchards were cut across and destroyed by the new boundary, bulldozed, allegedly for security reasons. Rafah became one of the three border points between Egypt and Israel.[3]{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"url\": \"https://archive.org/details/PalestineCensus1922\", \"editor \": \"Barron, J.

Their marriage took place in 193 BC in Raphia[20]\n\nHistory\nRafah has a history stretching back thousands of years. It was first recorded in an inscription of Egyptian Pharaoh Seti\u00a0I, from 1303 BCE as Rph, and as the first stop on Pharaoh Shoshenq\u00a0I's campaign to the Levant in 925\u00a0BCE. In 720 BCE it was the site of the Assyrian king Sargon\u00a0II's victory over the Egyptians, and in 217\u00a0BCE the Battle of Raphia was fought between the victorious Ptolemy\u00a0IV and Antiochus\u00a0III.[21] (It is said to be one of the largest battles ever fought in the Levant, with over a hundred thousand soldiers and hundreds of elephants).\nThe town was conquered by Alexander Yannai and held by the Hasmoneans until it was rebuilt in the time of Pompey and Gabinius; the latter seems to have done the actual work of restoration for the era of the town dates from 57\u00a0BCE. Rafah is mentioned in Strabo (16, 2, 31), the Antonine Itinerary, and is depicted on the Map of Madaba.[21]\nDuring the Byzantine period, it was a diocese,[21][22] and Byzantine ceramics and coins have been found there.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"url\": \"https://books.google.com/books?id=FC1mAAAAMAAJ\", \"last\": \"Dauphin\", \"first \": \"Claudine\", \"title \": \"La Palestine byzantine, Peuplement et Populations\", \"volume \": \"III : Catalogue\", \"series \": \"BAR International Series 726\", \"year \": \"1998\", \"publisher \": \"Archeopress\", \"location \": \"Oxford\", \"language \": \"French\"} It was represented at the Council of Ephesus 431 CE by Bishop Romanus, but today remains a titular see of the Roman Catholic Church[24] but a small Greek Orthodox presence exists.\n\nArab and Mamluk rule\nRafah was an important trading city during the early Arab period, and one of the towns captured by the Rashidun army under general 'Amr ibn al-'As in 635 CE.[25] Under the Umayyads and Abbasids, Rafah was the southernmost border of Jund Filastin (\"District of Palestine\"). According to Arab geographer al\u2011Ya'qubi, it was the last town in the Province of Syria and on the road from Ramla to Egypt.[26]\nA Jewish community settled in the city in the 9th and 10th centuries and again in the 12th, although in the 11th century it suffered a decline and in 1080 they migrated to Ashkelon. A Samaritan community also lived there during this period. Like most cities of southern Palestine, ancient Rafah had a landing place on the coast (now Tell Rafah), while the main city was inland.[21]\nIn 1226, Arab geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi writes of Rafah's former importance in the early Arab period, saying it was \"of old a flourishing town, with a market, and a mosque, and hostelries\". However, he goes on to say that in its current state, Rafah was in ruins, but was an Ayyubid postal station on the road to Egypt after nearby Deir al\u2011Balah.[26]\n\nOttoman and Egyptian period\nRafah appeared in the 1596 Ottoman tax registers as being in the Nahiya of Gaza of the Liwa of Gazza. It had a population of 15 households, all Muslim, who paid taxes on wheat, barley, summer crops, occasional revenues, goats and/or bee hives.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"last1\": \"H\\u00fctteroth\", \"first1\": \"Wolf-Dieter\", \"last2\": \"Abdulfattah\", \"first2\": \"Kamal\", \"url\": \"https://books.google.com/books?id=wqULAAAAIAAJ\", \"title \": \"Historical Geography of Palestine, Transjordan and Southern Syria in the Late 16th Century\", \"year \": \"1977\", \"publisher \": \"Erlanger Geographische Arbeiten, Sonderband 5.

In 1832, the area came under Egyptian occupation of Muhammad Ali, which lasted until 1840.\nThe French explorer Victor Gu\u00e9rin, who visited in May 1863, noted two pillars of granite which the locals called Bab el Medinet, meaning \"The Gate of the town\".{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"1869\", \"title\": \"Description G\\u00e9ographique Historique et Arch\\u00e9ologique de la Palestine\", \"url\": \"https://archive.org/details/descriptiongog02gu\", \"volume\": \"1: Judee, pt. 2\", \"location\": \"Paris\", \"publisher\": \"L'Imprimerie Nationale\", \"last\": \"Gu\\u00e9rin\", \"first\": \"V.\", \"authorlink\": \"Victor Gu\\u00e9rin\"} In 1881, Archduke Ludwig Salvator of Austria wrote: \"Fragments of gray granite pillars, still standing, are here to be met with about the road, the fields, and the sand, and we saw one lying on the ground half buried...

The presence of the army bases was an economic draw that brought people back to the city.\nIn the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Rafah had a population of 599 inhabitants, all Muslim,[13] increasing in the 1931 census to 1,423, still all Muslims, in 228 houses.[31]\nIn the 1945 statistics Rafah had a population of 2,220, all Muslims,[32] with 40,579 dunams of land, according to an official land and population survey.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"1945\", \"title\": \"Village Statistics, April, 1945\", \"url\": \"http://web.nli.org.il/sites/nli/Hebrew/library/Pages/BookReader.aspx?pid=856390\", \"author\": \"Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics\"} Of this, 275 dunams were plantations and irrigable land, 24,173 used for cereals,[33] while 16,131 dunams were un-cultivable land.[34]\n\n1948\u20131967\nAfter the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War, Egypt governed the area (see Palestinian Protectorate) and refugee camps were established. In the 1956 war involving Israel, Britain, France, and Egypt, 111 people, including 103 refugees, were killed by the Israeli army in the Palestinian refugee camp of Rafah, during the Rafah massacre. The United Nations was unable to determine the circumstances surrounding the deaths.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/6558F61D3DB6BD4505256593006B06BE\", \"title\": \"Archived copy\", \"accessdate\": \"2013-08-24\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20131104160006/http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/6558F61D3DB6BD4505256593006B06BE\"}{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://cosmos.ucc.ie/cs1064/jabowen/IPSC/php/place.php?plid=210\", \"title\": \"Rafah (articles/books/maps/cartoons/photographs/video or audio clips)\", \"website\": \"cosmos.ucc.ie\"}\nDuring the 1967 Six-Day War, the Israel Defense Forces captured Rafah with the Sinai Peninsula and Gaza Strip, the population was about 55,000, of whom only 11,000 lived in Rafah itself.\n\nAfter 1967\nIn the summer of 1971, the IDF, under General Ariel Sharon (then head of the IDF southern command), destroyed approximately 500 houses in the refugee camps of Rafah in order to create patrol roads for Israeli forces. These demolitions displaced nearly 4,000 people.[37] Israel established the Brazil and Canada housing projects to accommodate displaced Palestinians and to provide better conditions in the hopes of integrating the refugees into the general population and its standard of living;{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.shaml.org/publications/monos/mono4.htm\", \"title\": \"Archived copy\", \"accessdate\": \"2007-04-16\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20060914074542/http://www.shaml.org/publications/monos/mono4.htm\"} Brazil is immediate south of Rafah, while Canada was just across the border in Sinai. Both were named because UN peacekeeping troops from those respective countries had maintained barracks in those locations. After the 1978 Camp David Accords mandated the repatriation of Canada project refugees to the Gaza Strip, the Tel al-Sultan project, northwest of Rafah, was built to accommodate them.[39]\nIn May 2004, the Israeli Government led by, yet Prime Minister, Ariel Sharon approved another mass demolition of homes in Rafah. Therefore, he obtained the nickname \"the bulldozer\".[40]\nIn September 2005, Israel withdrew from the Gaza strip but Rafah remained divided, with part of it on the Egyptian side of the border under Egyptian rule. It has been claimed that it was in order to cope with the division of the town, that smugglers have made tunnels under the border, connecting the two parts and permitting the smuggling of goods and persons.[41]\n\nRafah Border Crossing\nRafah is the site of the Rafah Border Crossing, the sole crossing between the Gaza Strip and Egypt. Formerly operated by Israeli military forces, control of the crossing was transferred to the Palestinian Authority in September 2005 as part of the larger Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. A European Union commission began monitoring the crossing in November 2005 amid Israeli security concerns, and in April 2006, Palestinian Authority chairman Mahmoud Abbas's Presidential Guard assumed responsibility for the site on the Palestinian Authority side.[42]    On the Egyptian side, the responsibility is assumed by the 750 Border Guards allowed by an agreement of Egypt with Israel. The agreement was signed in November 2005 forced by US pressure, and specifies that it is under security requirements demanded by Israel.\n\nClimate\nK\u00f6ppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies its climate as hot semi-arid (BSh).{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://en.climate-data.org/location/478554/\", \"title\": \"Climate: Rafiah \\u2013 Climate graph, Temperature graph, Climate table\", \"publisher\": \"Climate-Data.org\"}{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://en.climate-data.org/location/3958/\", \"title\": \"Climate: Rafah \\u2013 Climate graph, Temperature graph, Climate table\", \"publisher\": \"Climate-Data.org\", \"accessdate\": \"2014-02-21\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20140223185030/http://en.climate-data.org/location/3958/\"}\n\nBibliography\n\n\nExternal links\n\n",
