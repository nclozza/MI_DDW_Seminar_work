It is a part of the area covered by the Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA). It is the headquarters of the Baruipur subdivision and also the seat for the district's Sub-Divisional Court. The Baruipur Police District is responsible for law enforcement in the city.\n\nHistory\nMany Janapadas grew up along the old Bhagirathi channel from the ancient times till around the 16th century: Kalighat, Boral, Rajpur, Mahinagar, Baruipur, Bahadu, Joynagar, Majilpur, Chatrabhog. Bipradas Pipilai\u2019s Manasavijaya, composed in 1495, mentions many places in this region. Baruipur was a populous city in the late 15th and early 16th century. \u201cChand Sadagar, a merchant character of Manasavijaya, reached Baruipur, from Kalighat, through the old Bhagirathi channel. From there he proceeded towards Chhatrabhog, and then traveling through Hatigarh pargana reached the open sea.\u201d Chaitanyadeva (1486-1534) also went through this route. Travelling by boat to Puri he halted at the village of Atisara, near Baruipur. \"His last stoppage in 24 Parganas was at Chhatrabhog, now a village within the jurisdiction of Mathurapur police station. Chhatrabhog seems to have been an important river-port on the old Bhagirathi channel.\"{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url \": \"http://wbplan.gov.in/HumanDev/DHDR/24%20pgsSouth/s24prg_main.htm\", \"title \": \"District Human Development Report: South 24 Parganas\", \"work\": \"Pages 3-4, Chapter I: South 24 Parganas: An overview\", \"publisher \": \"Department of Planning and Statistics, Government of West Bengal\", \"accessdate \": \"15 December 2019\", \"archiveurl \": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20161005044029/http://wbplan.gov.in/HumanDev/DHDR/24%20pgsSouth/s24prg_main.htm\", \"archivedate \": \"5 October 2016\", \"urlstatus \": \"dead\"}\nThe Gajan Utsab of Baruipur is famous. According to local legend, there was once a severely contested lathi fight between the lathials of the Sabarna Choudhury of Barisha and the Roy Choudhury of Baruipur concerning the boundary dispute of their respective Zamindaris. The Sardar of the lathials of the Sabarna Roy Choudhury was Bhriguram.\nThe lathials of Baruipur managed to cut off his head with a sword and won the fight. However, Bhriguram was so much respected in the area that a lock of his hair was preserved. Bhriguram is still publicly honoured by the exposition of lock during the\ngajan mela at Baruipur.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.hindubooks.org/temples/bengal/24Parganas/page5.htm\", \"title\": \"Hindu Books\", \"accessdate\": \"5 January 2007\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20070627021137/http://www.hindubooks.org/temples/bengal/24Parganas/page5.htm\", \"archivedate\": \"27 June 2007\"}\n\nArea overview\nBaruipur subdivision is a rural subdivision with moderate levels of urbanization. 31.05% of the population lives in the urban areas and 68.95% lives in the rural areas.

As of 2005-06, more than 1.7 million (17 lakhs) commuters use the Kolkata Suburban Railway system daily. After the partition of India, refugees from East Pakistan/ Bangladesh had a strong impact on the development of urban areas in the periphery of Kolkata. The new immigrants depended on Kolkata for their livelihood, thus increasing the number of commuters. For the increasing facilities drawn by commuting, population in the peripheries of the metropolitan  areas grew at a much faster rate than the metro core areas. During 1951 and 2011, population density has increased by only 1.5 times in the Kolkata Municipal Corporation area. In the Rajpur Sonarpur area, in the southern periphery of Kolkata, population density has increased 31 times during the same period. In the Baruipur urban area population density has increased by over 5 times.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"last\": \"Mondal\", \"first\": \"Bhaswati\", \"url \": \"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328319153\", \"title \": \"Commuting and Metropolitan Development of Kolkata\", \"publisher \": \"ResearchGate\", \"accessdate \": \"16 December 2019\"}\n\nTransport\nBaruipur Junction railway station is on the Sealdah-Namkhana line, the Sealdah-Diamond Harbour line and the Sealdah-Canning line.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url \": \"https://indiarailinfo.com/train/-train-sealdah-namkhana-local-34792/14397/325/9534\", \"title \": \"34792 Sealdah-Namkhana Local\", \"work \": \"Time Table\", \"publisher \": \"India Rail Info\", \"accessdate \": \"16 December 2019\"}{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url \": \"https://indiarailinfo.com/train/timetable/sealdah-diamond-harbour-local-34814/17067/325/8018#st\", \"title \": \"34814 Sealdah-Diamond Harbour Local\", \"work \": \"Time Table\", \"publisher \": \"India Rail Info\", \"accessdate \": \"16 December 2019\"}{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url \": \"https://indiarailinfo.com/train/timetable/sealdah-canning-local-34520/17315/325/7925#st\", \"title \": \"34520 Sealdah-Canning Local\", \"work \": \"Time Table\", \"publisher \": \"India Rail Info\", \"accessdate \": \"16 December 2019\"}\nBaruipur is also well connected with the SH\u20131 and Eastern Metropolitan Bypass.
