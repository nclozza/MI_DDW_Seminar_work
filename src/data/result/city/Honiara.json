    "content": "Honiara\n\nHoniara (/\u02ccho\u028ani\u02c8\u0251\u02d0r\u0259/) is the capital city of Solomon Islands, situated on the northwestern coast of Guadalcanal. As of 2017[update], it had a population of 84,520 people. The city is served by Honiara International Airport and the seaport of Point Cruz, and lies along the Kukum Highway.\nThe airport area to the east of Honiara was the site of a battle between the United States and the Japanese during the Guadalcanal Campaign in World War II, the Battle of Henderson Field of 1942, from which America emerged victorious. After Honiara became the new administrative centre of the British Solomon Islands Protectorate in 1952 with the addition of many administrative buildings, the town began to develop and grow in population. Since the late 1990s, Honiara has suffered a turbulent history of ethnic violence and political unrest and is scarred by rioting. A coup attempt in June 2000 resulted in violent rebellions and fighting between the ethnic Malaitans of the Malaita Eagle Force (MEF) and the Guadalcanal natives of the Isatabu Freedom Movement (IFM).\nAlthough a peace agreement was made in October 2000, violence ensued in the city streets in March 2002 when two diplomats from New Zealand and numerous others were murdered. In July 2003, conditions had become so bad in Honiara that the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI), consisting of multiple Pacific nations under Australian leadership, was invited into the country by the Solomons Government to restore order. In 2006, riots broke out following the election of Snyder Rini as Prime Minister, destroying a part of Chinatown and making more than 1,000 Chinese residents homeless. The riots devastated the town and tourism in the city and the islands was severely affected.\nHoniara contains the majority of the major government buildings and institutions of Solomon Islands. The National Parliament of Solomon Islands, Honiara Solomon Islands College of Higher Education, International School in Honiara and University of the South Pacific Solomon Islands are located in Honiara as is the national museum and Honiara Market. Politically Honiara is divided into three parliamentary constituencies, electing three of the 50 members of the National Parliament. These constituencies, East Honiara, Central Honiara and West Honiara, are three of only six constituencies in the country to have an electorate of over 10,000 people.\nHoniara is predominantly Christian and is served by the headquarters of the Church of the Province of Melanesia (Anglican), the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Honiara, the South Seas Evangelical Church, the United Church, the Seventh-day Adventist Church and other Christian churches.\n\nHistory\nThe name Honiara derives from nagho ni ara which roughly translates as \"place of the east wind\" or \"facing the southeast wind\" in one of the Guadalcanal languages.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"2006\", \"title\": \"Placenames of the World: Origins and Meanings of the Names for 6,600 Countries, Cities, Territories, Natural Features, and Historic Sites\", \"url\": \"https://books.google.com/books?id=M1JIPAN-eJ4C&pg=PA168\", \"publisher\": \"McFarland\", \"isbn\": \"978-0-7864-2248-7\", \"last\": \"Room\", \"first\": \"Adrian\"} The town has not been extensively documented and little detailed material exists on it.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"2000\", \"title\": \"Tradition, trade and woodcarving in Solomon Islands\", \"url\": \"https://books.google.com/books?id=UIHWAAAAMAAJ\", \"publisher\": \"Finnish Anthropological Society\", \"isbn\": \"978-952-9573-23-3\", \"last\": \"Kupiainen\", \"first\": \"Jari\"}\n\nWorld War II\nThe Battle of Henderson Field (1942), the last of the three major land offensives conducted by the Japanese during the Guadalcanal Campaign of World War II took place in what is now the airport area about 11 kilometres (6.8\u00a0mi) to the east of the city centre. During the battle, the US Marine and Army forces, under the overall command of Major General Alexander Vandegrift, repulsed an attack by the Japanese 17th Army, under the command of Japanese Lieutenant General Harukichi Hyakutake. {\"citetype\": \"book\", \"date\": \"1 May 2003\", \"title\": \"Flattop Fighting in World War II: The Battles Between American and Japanese Aircraft Carriers\", \"url\": \"https://books.google.com/books?id=cSkn4wfNR7sC&pg=PA125\", \"publisher\": \"McFarland\", \"isbn\": \"978-0-7864-1451-2\", \"last\": \"Degan\", \"first\": \"Patrick\"} The US forces were defending the Lunga River perimeter, which guarded Henderson Field on Guadalcanal, that had been captured from the Japanese by the Allies in landings on Guadalcanal on 7 August 1942. Hyakutake's force was sent to Guadalcanal in response to the Allied landings with the mission of recapturing the airfield and driving the Allied forces off of the island. The Japanese landed with 3,500 troops but the force soon grew to over 20,000 personnel, roughly equal to America's 23,000; each side had about 13,000 troops.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"date\": \"1 July 2007\", \"title\": \"Midway Inquest: Why the Japanese Lost the Battle of Midway\", \"url\": \"https://books.google.com/books?id=lOUPxsGwRLcC&pg=PA253\", \"publisher\": \"Indiana University Press\", \"isbn\": \"978-0-253-34904-0\", \"last\": \"Isom\", \"first\": \"Dallas Woodbury\"}\nFrom the top of Mount Austin at 410 metres (1,350\u00a0ft), panoramic views of the north coastal plains, Savo and Florida islands, and the battlefields of World War II can be seen. The Japanese held this hilltop in the second half of 1942 and showered artillery fire on American troops at the Henderson airfield below the hill. Eventually the hill was captured but the Japanese held on to the Gifu, Sea Horse, and Galloping Horse ridges for about a month. Most of the Japanese died of starvation, banzai assaults or direct killing.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"2000\", \"title\": \"Moon Handbooks South Pacific\", \"url\": \"https://books.google.com/books?id=EDGapfBX-CAC&pg=PA999\", \"publisher\": \"David Stanley\", \"isbn\": \"9781566911726\", \"last\": \"Stanley\", \"first\": \"David\"}\nHyakutake's soldiers conducted numerous assaults over three days at various locations around the Lunga perimeter. Along the Matanikau River, the principal river flowing through what is now central Honiara, tanks attacked in pairs across the sandbar at the mouth of the river behind a barrage of artillery. Artillery, including 37\u00a0mm (1.5\u00a0in) anti-tank guns, quickly destroyed all nine tanks. At the same time, four battalions of Marine artillery, totalling 40 howitzers, fired over 6,000 rounds into the area between Point Cruz and the Matanikau, causing heavy casualties in Nomasu Nakaguma's infantry battalions as they tried to approach the Marine lines. Both sides incurred heavy losses during the events of the overall battle, especially the Japanese attackers.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"date\": \"30 September 2004\", \"title\": \"World War II Pacific\", \"url\": \"https://books.google.com/books?id=un78XGbLMRUC&pg=PT36\", \"publisher\": \"Twenty-First Century Books\", \"isbn\": \"978-0-8225-0138-1\", \"last\": \"Williams\", \"first\": \"Barbara\"} After an attempt to deliver further reinforcements failed during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal in November 1942, Japan conceded defeat in the struggle for the island and evacuated many of its remaining forces by the first week of February 1943. The Quonset hut built by the Americans can still be seen in the back lanes of the town and numerous memorials give testament to the war.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"date\": \"21 August 2012\", \"title\": \"World War II Medal of Honor Recipients (1): Navy & USMC\", \"url\": \"https://books.google.com/books?id=LwKtZ0o5CCAC&pg=PA21\", \"publisher\": \"Osprey Publishing\", \"isbn\": \"978-1-78200-206-2\", \"last\": \"Hargis\", \"first\": \"Robert\"}\n\nModern development\nHoniara officially became the capital of the British Protectorate of Solomon Islands in 1952. The infrastructure had been well developed by the US during the war which dictated the decision of the British Government to shift the capital to Honiara.[8][9] Government buildings opened in Honiara from early January in 1952. Sir Robert Stanley was based at Honiara during his time as High Commissioner for the Western Pacific, which included the British Solomon Islands, the Condominium of New Hebrides (now Vanuatu) and the Gilbert and Ellice Islands colony (now Kiribati and Tuvalu).{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"2003\", \"title\": \"Journeys in a Small Canoe: The Life and Times of a Solomon Islander\", \"url\": \"https://books.google.com/books?id=hBBhhpC9jv0C&pg=PA48\", \"publisher\": \"editorips@usp.ac.fj\", \"isbn\": \"978-1-74076-032-4\", \"last\": \"Gina\", \"first\": \"Lloyd Maepeza\"} Dr. Macu Salato arrived in Honiara in early August 1954 and was based in the town, conducting surveys all across the islands and investigating leprosy.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"1998\", \"title\": \"He Served: A Biography of Macu Salato\", \"url\": \"https://books.google.com/books?id=YWaTEUTBA_EC&pg=PA26\", \"publisher\": \"editorips@usp.ac.fj\", \"isbn\": \"978-982-02-0133-0\", \"last\": \"Kiste\", \"first\": \"Robert C.\"} He departed and returned to Fiji in late March 1955.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"1998\", \"title\": \"He Served: A Biography of Macu Salato\", \"url\": \"https://books.google.com/books?id=YWaTEUTBA_EC&pg=PA26\", \"publisher\": \"editorips@usp.ac.fj\", \"isbn\": \"978-982-02-0133-0\", \"last\": \"Kiste\", \"first\": \"Robert C.\"}\nThe town grew after Honiara became the capital city, receiving two-thirds of the allocations granted for the country's economic development in the 1960s and 1970s, resulting in substantial infrastructure development. Population growth was very slow and only about 5% of Solomon Islanders were living in the city. However, the Bellonese population significantly increased; they established permanent and semi-permanent houses in the Honiara vicinity, typically along the banks of the White River.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"2000\", \"title\": \"Tradition, trade and woodcarving in Solomon Islands\", \"url\": \"https://books.google.com/books?id=UIHWAAAAMAAJ\", \"publisher\": \"Finnish Anthropological Society\", \"isbn\": \"978-952-9573-23-3\", \"last\": \"Kupiainen\", \"first\": \"Jari\"}  The town was affected by creolisation.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"last1\": \"Selbach\", \"first1\": \"Rachel\", \"last2\": \"Cardoso\", \"first2\": \"Hugo C.\", \"year\": \"2009\", \"title\": \"Gradual Creolization: Studies Celebrating Jacques Arends\", \"url\": \"https://books.google.com/books?id=9QZ6u36-vzEC&pg=PT51\", \"publisher\": \"John Benjamins Publishing\", \"isbn\": \"978-90-272-5256-2\", \"last3\": \"Van Den Berg\", \"first3\": \"Margot\"} In the 1960s, Pijin became its principal language, and the mother tongue of a generation of young urban adults and children.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"last1\": \"Kortmann\", \"first1\": \"Bernd\", \"last2\": \"Schneider\", \"first2\": \"Edgar W.\", \"title\": \"A handbook of varieties of English, Volume 2\", \"url\": \"https://books.google.com/books?id=mtd3a-56ysUC&pg=PA692\", \"publisher\": \"Walter de Gruyter\", \"isbn\": \"978-3-11-017532-5\", \"accessdate\": \"22 September 2012\"} Through Honiara the language spread and has since become the main language spoken in the islands.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"last1\": \"Kortmann\", \"first1\": \"Bernd\", \"last2\": \"Schneider\", \"first2\": \"Edgar W.\", \"title\": \"A handbook of varieties of English, Volume 2\", \"url\": \"https://books.google.com/books?id=mtd3a-56ysUC&pg=PA692\", \"publisher\": \"Walter de Gruyter\", \"isbn\": \"978-3-11-017532-5\", \"accessdate\": \"22 September 2012\"}\nRhys Richards, a New Zealand historian and former New Zealand High Commissioner of Solomon Islands, spent many years in Honiara.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"2007\", \"title\": \"Dancing, Dying, Crawling, Crying: Stories of Continuity and Change in the Polynesian Community of Tikopia\", \"url\": \"https://books.google.com/books?id=5Txqo7UPlhsC&pg=PR10\", \"publisher\": \"editorips@usp.ac.fj\", \"isbn\": \"978-982-01-0813-4\", \"last\": \"Treadaway\", \"first\": \"Julian\"} In 1979 Honiara was still a small town in terms of population, especially for a capital city, with 18,346 people, of which 10,870 were men, and 7,476 were women.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"date\": \"1 January 1984\", \"title\": \"Un jeune \\u00c9tat m\\u00e9lan\\u00e9sien: Les \\u00celes Salomon\", \"url\": \"https://books.google.com/books?id=fQND6sQi0YMC&pg=PA66\", \"language\": \"French\", \"publisher\": \"Presses Univ de Bordeaux\", \"isbn\": \"978-2-905081-03-2\", \"last\": \"Lemps\", \"first\": \"Christian Huetz de\"} In July 1978, Honiara became the new capital of the independent Solomon Islands.[8]\n\nConflict\nAn International Express Mail Agreement and regulations were signed between the United States and Solomon Islands governments in Honiara and Washington, D.C. on 19 April and 27 June 1991, coming into effect on 1 August 1991.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"2007\", \"title\": \"Treaties in Force: A List of Treaties and Other International Agreements of the United States in Force on January 1, 2007\", \"url\": \"https://books.google.com/books?id=Xw1G4UZTkLgC&pg=PA244\", \"publisher\": \"Government Printing Office\", \"isbn\": \"978-0-16-079737-8\", \"last\": \"States\", \"first\": \"United\"} On 6 November 1998, a peace agreement was signed in Honiara between the United States and Solomon Islands governments.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"2007\", \"title\": \"Treaties in Force: A List of Treaties and Other International Agreements of the United States in Force on January 1, 2007\", \"url\": \"https://books.google.com/books?id=Xw1G4UZTkLgC&pg=PA244\", \"publisher\": \"Government Printing Office\", \"isbn\": \"978-0-16-079737-8\", \"last\": \"States\", \"first\": \"United\"} However, since the late 1990s, Honiara has been the centre of ethnic violence and political unrest in the country.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"last1\": \"Cooper\", \"first1\": \"Chris\", \"last2\": \"Hall\", \"first2\": \"Colin Michael\", \"year\": \"2005\", \"title\": \"Oceania: A Tourism Handbook\", \"url\": \"https://books.google.com/books?id=0C3eTLu1uTUC&pg=PA253\", \"publisher\": \"Channel View Publications\", \"isbn\": \"978-1-873150-87-0\"} The area around Honiara was the battle ground of rival factions during the unrest as a result of the dominance of Malaitans, who were outsiders, and the local Guadalcanal islanders.[9]\nA coup attempt occurred in June 2000 which resulted in violent rebellions and fighting between the Malaita Eagle Force (MEF) and the Guadalcanal natives of the Isatabu Freedom Movement (IFM).

The Matanikau River flows through the town, past Chinatown, badly affected by the 2006 riot. The town revolves around the Kukum Highway, which connects it with the Honiara International Airport (formerly known as Henderson Field) about 11 kilometres (6.8\u00a0mi) to the east of Honiara across the Lunga River. To the west of the town center are the suburbs of White River and Tanaghai.[22]\nThe climate is tropical, more specifically a tropical rainforest climate, with an average daytime temperature of about 28\u00a0\u00b0C (82\u00a0\u00b0F). Honiara is wetter between November and April. The average precipitation per year is about 2,000 millimetres (79\u00a0in) and thus is lower than the average on the Solomon Islands as a whole (3,000 millimetres (120\u00a0in)). Honiara is subject to monsoons.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"1995\", \"title\": \"Cymatium Muricinum and Other Ranellid Gastropods: Major Predators of Cultured Tridacnid Clams\", \"url\": \"https://books.google.com/books?id=tFZuW48yVwEC&pg=PA93\", \"publisher\": \"The WorldFish Center\", \"isbn\": \"978-971-8709-70-2\", \"last\": \"Govan\", \"first\": \"Hugh\"}\n\nPolitics\nHoniara is divided into three parliamentary constituencies, electing three of the 50 Members of the National Parliament.

The park, the only children's recreation area in Honiara, is located along the eastern coast of Honiara town as all other areas in the region are private property. According to a study, the park is in danger and needs to be protected as the coastline is subject to erosion; the erosion is recorded to be about 6\u20138 metres (20\u201326\u00a0ft) between the old coastline and the eroded coastline. This erosion needs to be checked by building a retaining wall.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.usp.ac.fj/fileadmin/files/faculties/fste/geography/Earthcaching/students/Dalton/Dalton_Full_Report.pdf\", \"title\": \"Effects of rising sea levels at Children's Park \\u2013 Honiara, Solomon Islands\", \"date\": \"12 November 2010\", \"publisher\": \"usp.ac.fj\", \"format\": \"PDF\", \"accessdate\": \"24 September 2012\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20181003105128/http://www.usp.ac.fj/fileadmin/files/faculties/fste/geography/Earthcaching/students/Dalton/Dalton_Full_Report.pdf\", \"archivedate\": \"3 October 2018\"}\n\nWar memorial and peace park\nThe Guadalcanal American Memorial is an attraction.
