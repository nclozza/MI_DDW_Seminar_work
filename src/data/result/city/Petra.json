The Nabataeans were accustomed to living in the barren deserts, unlike their enemies, and were able to repel attacks by taking advantage of the area's mountainous terrain. They were particularly skillful in harvesting rainwater, agriculture and stone carving. Petra flourished in the 1st century AD, when its famous Khazneh structure \u2013 believed to be the mausoleum of Nabataean king Aretas IV \u2013 was constructed, and its population peaked at an estimated 20,000 inhabitants.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/archaeology-and-history/magazine/2016/01-02/petra/\", \"title\": \"Petra Lost and Found\", \"date\": \"2 January 2016\", \"accessdate\": \"8 April 2018\", \"work\": \"National Geographic\"}\nAlthough the Nabataean kingdom became a client state of the Roman Empire in the first century BC, it was only in 106 AD that it lost its independence. Petra fell to the Romans, who annexed Nabataea and renamed it as Arabia Petraea. Petra's importance declined as sea trade routes emerged, and after an earthquake in 363 destroyed many structures. In the Byzantine era several Christian churches were built, but the city continued to decline, and by the early Islamic era it was abandoned except for a handful of nomads. It remained unknown to the world until it was rediscovered in 1812 by Johann Ludwig Burckhardt.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"17 October 2003\", \"title\": \"ART REVIEW; Rose-Red City Carved From the Rock\", \"url\": \"https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/17/arts/art-review-rose-red-city-carved-from-the-rock.html\", \"first\": \"Grace\", \"last\": \"Glueck\", \"newspaper\": \"The New York Times\"}\nAccess to the city is through a 1.2-kilometre-long (0.75\u00a0mi) gorge called the Siq, which leads directly to the Khazneh. Famous for its rock-cut architecture and water conduit system, Petra is also called the 'Rose City' because of the colour of the stone from which it is carved.[11] It has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1985. UNESCO has described Petra as \"one of the most precious cultural properties of man's cultural heritage\".{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://whc.unesco.org/archive/advisory_body_evaluation/326.pdf\", \"title\": \"UNESCO advisory body evaluation\", \"accessdate\": \"2011-12-05\"} In 2007, Al-Khazneh was voted one of the New7Wonders of the World. Petra is a symbol of Jordan, as well as Jordan's most-visited tourist attraction. Tourist numbers peaked at 918,000 in 2010, but there followed a temporary slump during the political instability generated by the Arab Spring, which affected countries surrounding Jordan.[13] Visitor numbers subsequently increased and reached a record-breaking 1.1\u00a0million tourists in 2019, marking the first time that the figure rose above the 1\u00a0million mark.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.jordantimes.com/news/local/rose-red-city-petra-wraps-2019-record-breaking-1135300-visitors\", \"title\": \"Rose-red city of Petra wraps up 2019 with record-breaking 1,135,300 visitors\", \"date\": \"6 January 2020\", \"accessdate\": \"6 January 2020\", \"work\": \"The Jordan Times\"}\n\nImportance in antiquity\nPliny the Elder and other writers identify Petra as the capital of the Nabataean Kingdom and the centre of their caravan trade. Enclosed by towering rocks and watered by a perennial stream, Petra not only possessed the advantages of a fortress, but controlled the main commercial routes which passed through it to Gaza in the west, to Bosra and Damascus in the north, to Aqaba and Leuce Come on the Red Sea, and across the desert to the Persian Gulf.[4]\n\nWater control\nExcavations have demonstrated that it was the ability of the Nabataeans to control the water supply that led to the rise of the desert city, creating an artificial oasis. The area is visited by flash floods, but archaeological evidence shows that the Nabataeans controlled these floods by the use of dams, cisterns and water conduits. These innovations stored water for prolonged periods of drought and enabled the city to prosper from its sale.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://nabataea.net/waterw.html\", \"title\": \"Petra: Water Works\", \"publisher\": \"Nabataea.net\", \"accessdate\": \"2011-12-05\"}{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.agiweb.org/geotimes/june04/feature_petra.html\", \"title\": \"Geotimes \\u2013 June 2004 \\u2013 Petra: An Eroding Ancient City\", \"date\": \"2001-09-11\", \"publisher\": \"Agiweb.org\", \"accessdate\": \"2011-12-05\", \"author\": \"Lisa Pinsker\"}\n\nAccess routes\nIn ancient times, Petra might have been approached from the south on a track leading across the plain of Petra, around Jabal Haroun (\"Aaron's Mountain\"), the location of the Tomb of Aaron, said to be the burial place of Aaron, brother of Moses. Another approach was possibly from the high plateau to the north. Today, most modern visitors approach the site from the east. The impressive eastern entrance leads steeply down through a dark, narrow gorge, in places only 3\u20134\u00a0m (10\u201313\u00a0ft) wide, called the Siq (\"shaft\"), a natural geological feature formed from a deep split in the sandstone rocks and serving as a waterway flowing into Wadi Musa.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.robertfulford.com/petra.html\", \"title\": \"Robert Fulford's column about Petra, Jordan\", \"date\": \"1997-06-18\", \"publisher\": \"Robertfulford.com\", \"accessdate\": \"2014-02-06\"}\n\nCity centre\nAt the end of the narrow gorge, the Siq, stands Petra's most elaborate ruin, popularly known as Al Khazneh (\"the Treasury\"), hewn into the sandstone cliff. While remaining in remarkably preserved condition, the face of the structure is marked by hundreds of bullet holes made by the local Bedouin tribes that hoped to dislodge riches that were once rumoured to be hidden within it.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.robertfulford.com/petra.html\", \"title\": \"Robert Fulford's column about Petra, Jordan\", \"date\": \"1997-06-18\", \"publisher\": \"Robertfulford.com\", \"accessdate\": \"2014-02-06\"} A little further from the Treasury, at the foot of the mountain called en-Nejr, is a massive theatre, positioned so as to bring the greatest number of tombs within view. At the point where the valley opens out into the plain, the site of the city is revealed with striking effect. The theatre has been cut into the hillside and into several of the tombs during its construction. Rectangular gaps in the seating are still visible. Almost enclosing it on three sides are rose-coloured mountain walls, divided into groups by deep fissures and lined with knobs cut from the rock in the form of towers.[4]\n\nHuge structure discovered in 2016\nIn 2016, archaeologists using satellite imagery and drones discovered a very large, previously unknown monumental structure whose beginnings were tentatively dated to about 150 BCE, the time when the Nabataeans initiated their public building programme. It is located outside the main area of the city, at the foot of Jabal an-Nmayr and about 0.5\u00a0mi (0.80\u00a0km) south of the city centre, but is facing east, not towards the city, and has no visible relationship to it. The structure consists of a huge, 184 by 161\u00a0ft (56 by 49\u00a0m) platform, with a truly monumental staircase all along its eastern side. The large platform enclosed a slightly smaller one, topped with a comparatively small building, 28 by 28\u00a0ft (8.5 by 8.5\u00a0m), which was facing east toward the staircase. The structure, second in size only to the Monastery complex, probably had a ceremonial function of which not even a speculative explanation has yet been offered by the researchers.{\"citetype\": \"journal\", \"last1\": \"Parcak\", \"first1\": \"Sarah\", \"last2\": \"Tuttle\", \"first2\": \"Christopher A.\", \"date\": \"May 2016\", \"title\": \"Hiding in Plain Sight: The Discovery of a New Monumental Structure at Petra, Jordan, Using WorldView-1 and WorldView-2 Satellite Imagery\", \"journal\": \"Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research\", \"volume\": \"375\", \"issue\": \"375\", \"pages\": \"35\\u201351\", \"doi\": \"10.5615/bullamerschoorie.375.0035\", \"issn\": \"0003-097X\", \"jstor\": \"10.5615/bullamerschoorie.375.0035\"}{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"10 June 2016\", \"title\": \"Archaeologists discover massive Petra monument that could be 2,150 years old\", \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/09/petra-buried-monument-discovered-jordan\", \"work\": \"The Guardian\", \"accessdate\": \"10 June 2016\"}{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"8 June 2016\", \"title\": \"Massive New Monument Found in Petra\", \"url\": \"http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/06/space-archaeology-satellite-petra-ancient-city-discovery-jordan-monument/\", \"work\": \"National Geographic\", \"accessdate\": \"10 June 2016\"}\n\nClimate\nIn Petra, there is a semi-arid climate. Most rain falls in the winter. The K\u00f6ppen-Geiger climate classification is BSk. The average annual temperature in Petra is 15.5\u00a0\u00b0C (59.9\u00a0\u00b0F). About 193\u00a0mm (7.60\u00a0in) of precipitation falls annually.\n\nHistory\nThough the city was founded relatively late, a sanctuary has existed there since very ancient times[when?].[citation needed]\n\nNeolithic\nBy 7000 BCE, some of the earliest recorded farmers had settled in Beidha, a Pre-Pottery Neolithic settlement just north of Petra.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.petranationalfoundation.org/history.html\", \"title\": \"A Short History\", \"publisher\": \"Petra National Foundation\", \"accessdate\": \"13 February 2014\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20171204141534/http://www.petranationalfoundation.org/history.html\", \"archivedate\": \"4 December 2017\"}\n\nBronze Age\nPetra[dubious  \u2013 discuss] is listed in Egyptian campaign accounts and the Amarna letters as Pel, Sela or Seir.[citation needed]\n\nIron Age Edom\nThe Edomite site excavated at the top of the Umm el-Biyara mountain at Petra was established not earlier than the seventh century BCE (Iron II).[21]\n\nThe emergence of Rekem/Petra\nThe Nabataeans were one among several nomadic Bedouin tribes that roamed the Arabian Desert and moved with their herds to wherever they could find pasture and water.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"2001\", \"title\": \"Petra and the Lost Kingdom of the Nabataeans\", \"url\": \"https://books.google.com/books?id=FcAoBq4_EnEC\", \"location\": \"London, United Kingdom\", \"publisher\": \"[[I.B.Tauris]]\", \"pages\": \"14, 17, 30, 31\", \"isbn\": \"9781860645082\", \"accessdate\": \"8 July 2016\", \"first\": \"Taylor\", \"last\": \"Jane\"} Although the Nabataeans were initially embedded in Aramaic culture, theories about them having Aramean roots are rejected by modern scholars.

Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica (1911) states that the Semitic name of the city, if not Sela, would remain unknown. It nevertheless cautioned that sela simply means \"rock\" in Hebrew, and thence might not be identified with a city where it occurs in the biblical text.[4]\nThe passage in Diodorus Siculus (xix. 94\u201397) which describes the expeditions which Antigonus sent against the Nabataeans in 312 BCE, was understood by some researchers \u2014 and not so by others \u2014 to throw some light upon the history of Petra, but the \"petra\" (Greek for rock) referred to as a natural fortress and place of refuge cannot be a proper name, and the description implies that there was no town in existence there at the time.[4][26]\n\nRoman period\nIn AD 106, when Cornelius Palma was governor of Syria, the part of Arabia under the rule of Petra was absorbed into the Roman Empire as part of Arabia Petraea, and Petra became its capital.[27] The native dynasty came to an end but the city continued to flourish under Roman rule. It was around this time that the Petra Roman Road[dubious  \u2013 discuss] was built. A century later, in the time of Alexander Severus, when the city was at the height of its splendor, the issue of coinage comes to an end. There is no more building of sumptuous tombs, owing apparently to some sudden catastrophe, such as an invasion by the neo-Persian power under the Sassanid Empire.[4]\nMeanwhile, as Palmyra (fl. 130\u2013270) grew in importance and attracted the Arabian trade away from Petra, the latter declined. It appears, however, to have lingered on as a religious centre. Another Roman road was constructed at the site. Epiphanius of Salamis (c.315\u2013403) writes that in his time a feast was held there on December 25 in honour of the virgin Khaabou (Chaabou) and her offspring Dushara.[4] Dushara and al-Uzza were two of the main deities of the city, which otherwise included many idols from other Nabatean deities such as Allat and Manat.[28]\nBetween 111 and 114, Trajan built the Via Traiana Nova, running from the Syrian border to the Red Sea through Petra. This road followed the old routes of Nabataean caravans. In the shadow of the Pax Romana, this route revived trade between Arabia, Syria, and Mediterranean harbors. In 125 AD, one of Emperor Hadrian's administrators left marks[dubious  \u2013 discuss] in Petra, pointed out by documents found at the Dead Sea. In 130 AD, Hadrian visited the former Nabataean capital, giving it the name of Hadriane Petra Metropolis, imprinted on his coins. His visit, however, did not lead to any boom in architectural development and new buildings as it did in Jerash. The province's governor, Sextius Florentinus, erected a monumental mausoleum for his son near the end of the al-Hubta (King's Wall) tombs, which had been generally reserved during the Nabataean period for the royal family.\nThe interest that Roman emperors showed for the city in the 3rd century suggests that Petra and its environs remained highly esteemed for a long time. An inscription to Liber Pater, a god revered by Emperor Septimius Severus, was found in the temenos of the temple known as Qasr al-Bint, and Nabataean tombs contained silver coins with the Emperor's portrait, as well as pottery from his reign. Emperor Elagabalus declared Petra to be a \"Roman colony\" when he reorganised the Roman Empire towards the end of the 3rd century.[29] The area from Petra to Wadi Mujib, the Negev, and the Sinai Peninsula were annexed into the province of Palaestina Salutaris. Petra may be seen on the mosaic map of Madaba from the reign of Emperor Justinian.\n\nByzantine period\nPetra declined rapidly under Roman rule, in large part from the revision of sea-based trade routes. In 363 an earthquake destroyed many buildings, and crippled the vital water management system.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"2003-10-17\", \"title\": \"ART REVIEW; Rose-Red City Carved From the Rock\", \"url\": \"https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D03E3DF143EF934A25753C1A9659C8B63\", \"work\": \"The New York Times\", \"accessdate\": \"2010-05-22\", \"first\": \"Grace\", \"last\": \"Glueck\"} The old city of Petra was the capital of the Byzantine province of Palaestina III and many churches were excavated in and around Petra from the Byzantine period.

The archaeologist Philip Hammond from the University of Utah, US, has visited Petra for nearly 40 years. He explains that the local folklore says it was created by the wand of Moses, when he struck the rock to bring forth water for the Israelites. Hammond believes the carved channels deep within the walls and ground were made from ceramic pipes that once fed water for the city, from rock-cut systems on the canyon rim.[35]\nBecause the structures weakened with age, many of the tombs became vulnerable to thieves, and many treasures were stolen. In 1929, a four-person team, consisting of British archaeologists Agnes Conway and George Horsfield, Palestinian physician and folklore expert Dr Tawfiq Canaan and Dr Ditlef Nielsen, a Danish scholar, excavated and surveyed Petra.[36]\nNumerous scrolls in Greek and dating to the Byzantine period were discovered in an excavated church near the Winged Lion Temple in Petra in December 1993.[37]\n\nUNESCO listing of ancient Petra and Bedouin heritage\nThe Bidoul/Bidul (Petra Bedouin) were forcibly resettled from their cave dwellings in Petra to Umm Sayhoun/Um Seihun by the Jordanian government in 1985, prior to the UNESCO designation process.[citation needed] They were provided with block-built housing with some infrastructure including in particular a sewage and drainage system. Among the six communities in the Petra Region, Umm Sayhoun is one of the smaller communities. The village of Wadi Musa is the largest in the area, inhabited largely by the Layathnah Bedouin, and is now the closest settlement to the visitor centre, the main entrance via the Siq and the archaeological site generally.

It has worked with numerous local and international organisations on projects that promote the protection, conservation, and preservation of the Petra site.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.petranationaltrust.org/UI/ShowContent.aspx?ContentId=1\", \"title\": \"Petra National Trust-About\", \"publisher\": \"Petranationaltrust.org\", \"accessdate\": \"2011-12-05\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20111228122554/http://petranationaltrust.org/ui/ShowContent.aspx?ContentId=1\", \"archivedate\": \"2011-12-28\"} Moreover, UNESCO and ICOMOS recently collaborated to publish their first book on human and natural threats to the sensitive World Heritage sites. They chose Petra as its first and the most important example of threatened landscapes. The presentation Tourism and Archaeological Heritage Management at Petra: Driver to Development or Destruction? (2012) was the first in a series to address the very nature of these deteriorating buildings, cities, sites, and regions.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://openarchive.icomos.org/1208/1/III-1-Article2_Comer_Willems.pdf\", \"title\": \"Tourism and Archaeological Heritage Management at Petra: Driver to Development or Destruction?\", \"accessdate\": \"2015-09-10\", \"author\": \"Comer and Willems\"} The next books in the series of deteriorating UNESCO World Heritage Sites will include Machu Picchu, Angkor Wat, and Pompeii.\nPeople for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) released a video in 2018 highlighting abuse against working animals in Petra. PETA claimed that animals are forced to carry tourists or pull carriages every day. The video showed handlers beating and whipping working animals, with beatings intensifying when animals faltered. PETA also revealed some wounded animals, including camels with fly-infested, open wounds.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"January 16, 2018\", \"title\": \"Jordan urged to end animal mistreatment at Petra site\", \"url\": \"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-42692743\", \"accessdate\": \"February 28, 2018\", \"last\": \"Usher\", \"first\": \"Sebastian\", \"newspaper\": \"[[BBC News]]\"} The Jordanian authority running the site responded by opening up a veterinarian clinic, and by spreading awareness among animal handlers.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://jordantimes.com/news/local/stakeholders-take-steps-address-animal-abuse-petra\", \"title\": \"Stakeholders take steps to address animal abuse in Petra\", \"date\": \"5 April 2018\", \"publisher\": \"The Jordan Times\", \"accessdate\": \"19 April 2018\", \"work\": \"Saeb Rawashdeh\"}\n\nReligion\nThe Nabataeans worshipped Arab gods and goddesses during the pre-Islamic era as well as a few of their deified kings. One, Obodas I, was deified after his death. Dushara was the primary male god accompanied by his three female deities: Al-\u2018Uzz\u00e1, Allat and Man\u0101t. Many statues carved in the rock depict these gods and goddesses. New evidence indicates that broader Edomite, and Nabataean theology had strong links to Earth-Sun relationships, often manifested in the orientation of prominent Petra structures to equinox and solstice sunrises and sunsets.[49]\nA stele dedicated to Qos-Allah 'Qos is Allah' or 'Qos the god', by Qosmilk (melech \u2013 king) is found at Petra (Glueck 516). Qos is identifiable with Kaush (Qaush) the God of the older Edomites. The stele is horned and the seal from the Edomite Tawilan near Petra identified with Kaush displays a star and crescent (Browning 28), both consistent with a moon deity. It is conceivable that the latter could have resulted from trade with Harran (Bartlett 194). There is continuing debate about the nature of Qos (qaus \u2013 bow) who has been identified both with a hunting bow (hunting god) and a rainbow (weather god) although the crescent above the stele is also a bow.[citation needed]\nNabatean inscriptions in Sinai and other places display widespread references to names including Allah, El and Allat (god and goddess), with regional references to al-Uzza, Baal and Manutu (Manat) (Negev 11). Allat is also found in Sinai in South Arabian language. Allah occurs particularly as Garm-'allahi \u2013 god decided (Greek Garamelos) and Aush-allahi \u2013 'gods covenant' (Greek Ausallos). We find both Shalm-lahi 'Allah is peace' and Shalm-allat, 'the peace of the goddess'. We also find Amat-allahi 'she-servant of god' and Halaf-llahi 'the successor of Allah'.[50]\nRecently, Petra has been put forward as the original 'Mecca' by some in the revisionist school of Islamic studies, owing to claims of large numbers of independent pieces of evidence, namely that the early original mosques faced Petra, not Jerusalem or Mecca, as the direction of Muslim prayer, the qibla.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"last1\": \"Gibson\", \"first1\": \"Dan\", \"year\": \"2017\", \"title\": \"Early Islamic Qiblas: A survey of mosques built between 1AH/622 C.E. and 263 AH/876 C.E.\", \"isbn\": \"978-1927581223\"} However, others have challenged the notion of comparing modern readings of Qiblah directions to early mosques\u2019 Qiblahs as they claim early Muslims could not accurately calculate the direction of the Qiblah to Mecca and so the apparent pinpointing of Petra by some early mosques may well be coincidental.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"last1\": \"King\", \"first1\": \"David A.\", \"title\": \"The Petra Fallacy\", \"url\": \"https://www.academia.edu/37957366\"}\nThe Monastery, Petra's largest monument, dates from the 1st century BC. It was dedicated to Obodas I and is believed to be the symposium of Obodas the god. This information is inscribed on the ruins of the Monastery (the name is the translation of the Arabic \"Ad Deir\").[citation needed]\nChristianity found its way to Petra in the 4th century AD, nearly 500 years after the establishment of Petra as a trade centre. Athanasius mentions a bishop of Petra (Anhioch. 10) named Asterius. At least one of the tombs (the \"tomb with the urn\"?) was used as a church. An inscription in red paint records its consecration \"in the time of the most holy bishop Jason\" (447). After the Islamic conquest of 629\u2013632, Christianity in Petra, as of most of Arabia, gave way to Islam. During the First Crusade Petra was occupied by Baldwin I of the Kingdom of Jerusalem and formed the second fief of the barony of Al Karak (in the lordship of Oultrejordain) with the title Ch\u00e2teau de la Val\u00e9e de Moyse or Sela. It remained in the hands of the Franks until 1189.[4] It is still a titular see of the Catholic Church.[53]\nTwo Crusader-period castles are known in and around Petra. The first is al-Wu'ayra and is situated just north of Wadi Musa. It can be viewed from the road to \"Little Petra\". It is the castle of Valle Moise which was seized by a band of Turks with the help of local Muslims and only recovered by the Crusaders after they began to destroy the olive trees of Wadi Musa. The potential loss of livelihood led the locals to negotiate surrender. The second is on the summit of el-Habis in the heart of Petra and can be accessed from the West side of the Qasr al-Bint.\nAccording to Arab tradition, Petra is the spot where Musa (Moses) struck a rock with his staff and water came forth, and where Moses' brother, Harun (Aaron), is buried, at Mount Hor, known today as Jabal Haroun or Mount Aaron. The Wadi Musa or \"Wadi of Moses\" is the Arab name for the narrow valley at the head of which Petra is sited. A mountaintop shrine of Moses' sister Miriam was still shown to pilgrims at the time of Jerome in the 4th century, but its location has not been identified since.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.sacredsites.com/middle_east/jordan/petra_ruins.htm\", \"title\": \"Petra\", \"publisher\": \"Sacred Sites\", \"accessdate\": \"2011-12-05\"}\n\nMusic and musical videos\nThe power metal band Helloween mentions this city in their song Nabataea (song) which appear in their 2013 album Straight Out Of Hell\n\nReferences\nNotes\nBibliography\n",
