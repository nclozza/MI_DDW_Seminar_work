The region was originally called Suomi (Finland), which later became the name for the whole country. \nIt is unknown when Turku gained city rights. The Pope first mentioned the town Aboa in his Bulla in 1229 and the year is now used as the foundation year of the city.\nAs the oldest town in the country Turku was the most important city in Finland, a status it retained for hundreds of years throughout the centuries under the rule of the Kingdom of Sweden. After the war Finland became an autonomous grand duchy of the Russian Empire (1809) under the direct rule of the Czar and the capital of the autonomous  Grand Duchy of Finland was moved to Helsinki (1812).\nIt was only after the last great fire in 1827 that most governmental institutions were moved to Helsinki along with the Academy of Turku (Turun Akatemia) founded in 1640, which then became the University of Helsinki.\nTurku continued to be the most populous city in Finland until the end of the 1840s, and it remains the regional capital and an important business and cultural center and port.\nBecause of its long history, it has been the site of many important events, and has extensively influenced Finnish history. The history of the country is closely linked to Turku, the former capital.\nAlong with Tallinn, the capital city of Estonia, Turku was designated the European Capital of Culture for 2011. In 1996, it was declared the official Christmas City of Finland.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.turku.fi/public/default.aspx?nodeid=9289&culture=en-US&contentlan=2\", \"title\": \"Christmas City \\u00bb Turku, the Finnish Christmas City\", \"publisher\": \"www.turku.fi\", \"accessdate\": \"2009-05-06\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20110716095158/https://www.turku.fi/public/default.aspx?nodeid=9289&culture=en-US&contentlan=2\"}\nDue to its location, Turku is a notable commercial and passenger seaport with over three million passengers traveling through the Port of Turku each year to Stockholm and Mariehamn.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"title \": \"Statistical yearbook of Turku\", \"url \": \"http://www.turku.fi/Public/default.aspx?nodeid=3981&culture=en-US&contentlan=2\", \"date \": \"2008-07-17\", \"language \": \"Finnish\", \"urlstatus \": \"dead\", \"archiveurl \": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20070927175319/https://www.turku.fi/Public/default.aspx?nodeid=3981&culture=en-US&contentlan=2\"}\nAs of 30 September 2018, the population of Turku was 191,499{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://pxnet2.stat.fi/PXWeb/pxweb/en/StatFin/StatFin__vrm__vamuu/statfin_vamuu_pxt_001.px/table/tableViewLayout2/?rxid=be87bf03-2bee-49e1-8a2f-ad390937d954\", \"title\": \"Preliminary population 2018\", \"date\": \"5 November 2018\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20141029190516/http://vrk.fi/default.aspx?docid=8639&site=3&id=0\"} making it the sixth largest city in Finland.[4] There were 330,192{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://pxnet2.stat.fi/PXWeb/pxweb/en/StatFin/StatFin__vrm__vamuu/statfin_vamuu_pxt_001.px/table/tableViewLayout2/?rxid=be87bf03-2bee-49e1-8a2f-ad390937d954\", \"title\": \"Turku sub-regional unit, Preliminary population by Month\"} inhabitants living in the Turku sub-region, ranking it as the third largest urban area in Finland after the Greater Helsinki area and Tampere sub-region. The city is officially bilingual as 5.2 percent of its population identify Swedish as a mother-tongue.[5]\n\nNames and etymology\nThe Finnish name Turku originates from an Old East Slavic word, t\u01d4rg\u01d4, meaning \"market place\".{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.katajala.net/keskiaika/suomi/kaupungit.html\", \"title\": \"Keskiaika - Suomen kaupungit keskiajalla\", \"publisher\": \"Katajala.net\"} The word turku still means \"market place\" in some Finnish dialects. \nThe Swedish name \u00c5bo may be a simple combination of \u00e5 (\"river; creek; large stream\") and bo (\"dwelling\"). As this pattern does not appear in any other Swedish place names in Finland, etymologists believe there could be a different explanation. One theory is that it comes from \"Aabo\", the Finnish rendition of the Russian \"Avram\" (Abraham), which could also be the origin of the name of the river Aura.[16] There is however an old legal term called \"\u00e5bor\u00e4tt\u00a0[sv]\" (meaning roughly \"right to live at\"), which gave citizens (called \"\u00e5bo\") the inheritable right to live at land owned by the crown (\u00e5 meant at or on in old Swedish, now p\u00e5).[17]\nIn Finnish, the genitive of Turku is Turun, meaning \"of Turku\". The Finnish names of organizations and institutes of Turku often begin with this word, as in Turun yliopisto for the University of Turku.\n\nHistory\nTurku has a long history as Finland's largest city and occasionally as the administrative center of the country, but for the last two hundred years has been surpassed by Helsinki. The city's identity stems from its status as the oldest city in Finland{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.visitfinland.com/W5/index.nsf/(pages)/Destinations\", \"title\": \"Destinations in Finland - Official Travel and Tourism Guide\", \"publisher\": \"Visitfinland.com\"} and the country's first capital. Originally, the word \"Finland\" referred only to the area around Turku (hence the title, \"Finland Proper\" for the region).\nAlthough archaeological findings in the area date back to the Stone Age and early literary sources such as Al-Idrisi's world map from 1154 mentions Turku, the town of Turku was officially founded in late 13th century.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.utu.fi/media/ajankohtaista/argumentit/AkiPihlman.html\", \"title\": \"Varhainen Turku rakennettiin pellolle\", \"date\": \"2006-09-13\", \"language\": \"Finnish\", \"accessdate\": \"2008-05-06\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20090113003534/https://www.utu.fi/media/ajankohtaista/argumentit/AkiPihlman.html\", \"author\": \"Aki Pihlman\"} Turku Cathedral was consecrated in 1300.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"2012\", \"title\": \"Lutheran Churches in Early Modern Europe\", \"url\": \"https://books.google.com/books?id=GyErqszUsFYC&pg=PA314\", \"publisher\": \"Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.\", \"isbn\": \"978-0-7546-6583-0\", \"author\": \"Andrew Spicer\"}\nDuring the Middle Ages, Turku was the seat of the Bishop of Turku (a title later upgraded to Archbishop of Turku), covering the then eastern half of the Kingdom of Sweden (most of the present-day Finland) until the 17th century. Even if Turku had no official capital status, both the short-lived institutions of Dukes and Governors-General of Finland usually had their Finnish residences there. In the aftermath of the War against Sigismund, the town was the site of the \u00c5bo Bloodbath. In 1640, the first university in Finland, the Royal Academy of Turku, was founded in Turku. Turku was also the meeting place for the States of Finland in 1676.\nAfter the Finnish War, which ended when Sweden ceded Finland to Imperial Russia at the Treaty of Fredrikshamn in 1809, Turku became briefly the official capital, but soon lost the status to Helsinki, as Emperor Alexander I felt that Turku was too far from Russia and too aligned with Sweden to serve as the capital of the Grand Duchy of Finland.[citation needed] The change officially took place in 1812. The government offices that remained in Turku were finally moved to the new capital after the Great Fire of Turku, which almost completely destroyed the city in 1827.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.visitturku.fi/en/where-did-great-fire-of-turku-begin_en\", \"title\": \"Where did the Great Fire of Turku begin?\", \"last\": \"route66\", \"date\": \"2016-11-11\", \"website\": \"Visit Turku\", \"language\": \"fi\"} After the fire, a new and safer city plan was drawn up by German architect Carl Ludvig Engel, who had also designed the new capital, Helsinki. Turku remained the largest city in Finland for another twenty years.\nIn 1918, a new university, the \u00c5bo Akademi \u2013 the only Swedish language university in Finland \u2013 was founded in Turku. Two years later, the Finnish language University of Turku was founded alongside it. These two universities are the second and third to be founded in Finland, both by private donations.\nIn the 20th century, Turku was called \"Finland's gateway to the West\" by historians such as Jarmo Virmavirta. The city enjoyed good connections with other Western European countries and cities, especially since the 1940s with Stockholm across the Gulf of Bothnia. In the 1960s, Turku became the first Western city to sign a twinning agreement with Leningrad in the Soviet Union, leading to greater inter-cultural exchange and providing a new meaning to the city's 'gateway' function. After the fall of Communism in Russia, many prominent Soviets came to Turku to study Western business practices, among them Vladimir Putin, then Leningrad's deputy mayor.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.triposo.com/loc/Turku/history/background\", \"title\": \"Turku History\", \"website\": \"www.triposo.com\", \"language\": \"en\"}\nAs for architecture in the city, both the body of architectural styles as well as the prevalent way of living have experienced significant changes in the 20th century. While having survived relatively intact throughout the years of war 1939\u20131945[citation needed], the city faced increasing changes in the 1950s and 1960s due to rising demands for apartments, the eagerness to rebuild, and most of all the new development of infrastructure (especially increased automobile traffic). The wooden one- to two-story houses that were the dominant mode of building in the city were mostly demolished in the 1950s and 1960s to both enable more efficient building and to ease vehicle traffic. This resulted in the destruction of buildings that were, in later decades, seen as beautiful and worth saving. Some individual buildings remain controversial to this day when it comes to their demolition in the decades after the war. For example, the building of Hotel Phoenix that stood on corner of the Market Square was torn down to make way for a large, multistory apartment building in 1959. The building was significant both for its location and history: having stood on one of the most valuable lots in the city center since 1878, the building had, for example, served as the first main building of the University of Turku. Other buildings whose demolition was seen as scandalous, either already at the time of action or proved to be so in later years, include The Nobel House (subject to the very first photograph ever taken in Finland) and the building of Old Hotel B\u00f6rs which was built in jugendstil in 1909 by Frithiof Strandell.\n\nGeography\nLocated at the mouth of the Aura river in the southwestern corner of Finland, Turku covers an area of 245 square kilometres (95\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of land, spread over both banks of the river. The eastern side, where the Turku Cathedral is located, is popularly referred to as t\u00e4l pual jokke (\"this side of the river\"), while the western side is referred to as tois pual jokke (\"the other side of the river\"). The city center is located close to the river mouth, on both sides of the river, though development has recently been expanding westward.[citation needed]\nThere are ten bridges over the Aura river in Turku. The oldest of the current bridges is Auransilta, which was constructed in 1904. The newest bridge is Kirjastosilta ('library bridge'), a pedestrian-only bridge built in 2013.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.turku.fi/public/?contentid=480599&nodeid=23\", \"title\": \"Kirjastosilta avattiin tulen ja valon juhlassa\", \"publisher\": \"www.turku.fi\", \"accessdate\": \"2014-01-10\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20140114100705/https://www.turku.fi/public/?contentid=480599&nodeid=23\"} The F\u00f6ri, a small ferry that transports pedestrians and bicycles across the river without payment, is a well known feature of the city.\nWith a population of approximately 300,000[citation needed], the Turku Region (LAU\u00a01) is the third largest urban region in Finland, after Greater Helsinki and the area around Tampere. The region includes, in addition to the city itself the following municipalities: Askainen, Kaarina, Lemu, Lieto, Masku, Merimasku, Myn\u00e4m\u00e4ki, Naantali, Nousiainen, Paimio, Piikki\u00f6, Raisio, Rusko, Rym\u00e4ttyl\u00e4, Sauvo, Vahto, and Velkua.\nA more exclusive definition for the urban area is the city region of Turku with a population around 235,000 consisting of four major municipalities Kaarina, Raisio, Naantali, and Turku.\n\nAdministrative subdivisions\nThe city is divided into 78 districts and nine wards that do not function as local government units. There are, however, some projects that are based on the district divisions, particularly in the eastern part of the city, where unemployment is high in certain areas. The largest populated districts are Varissuo and Runosm\u00e4ki. By area, however, Kakskerta and Paattinen, formed from former municipalities that were annexed to the city proper in the mid-20th century, constitute the largest districts.[citation needed]\nAs many of the small neighbouring municipalities from the north and south of the city were annexed during the mid-20th century, Turku is today shaped like an elongated pear. The city centre and most of the suburban areas lie in the middle, separated from the less densely populated northern rural areas by the Turku bypass, that forms part of European route E18. Islands such as Ruissalo, Hirvensalo and Kakskerta, forming the southern part of the city, are also sparsely populated and mostly contain summer residences, with the exception of some districts in Hirvensalo which are currently growing into upper-middle-class suburbs.\n\nClimate\nSituated by the Baltic Sea and sheltered by the islands of the Archipelago Sea, Turku has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfb). Like much of southern Finland, the city experiences warm summers, with temperatures ranging up to 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F), and relatively cold winters with frequent snowfall. The warmest month of the year is July, with an average temperature of 17.5\u00a0\u00b0C (64\u00a0\u00b0F), whereas the coldest month is February. The average year-round temperature is 5.5\u00a0\u00b0C (42\u00a0\u00b0F). Winter usually starts in early December, and spring in late March.\nPrecipitation in Turku averages 720\u00a0mm (28.3\u00a0in) a year. The rainiest month of the year is August, when the city receives on average 80\u00a0mm (3.1\u00a0in) of rainfall. In April, the driest month of the year, the figure is only 32\u00a0mm (1.3\u00a0in). The average air pressure at sea level is 101.2 kilopascals (29.9\u00a0inHg), with little variance throughout the year.\nOperational since 1955, the city's weather station is located at an altitude of 47 metres (154 feet) at Turku Airport.[24]\n\nDemographics\nAt the end of 2004, the Turku region (including the economic districts of Turku and \u00c5boland) had a population of 319,632, out of which 174,824 people lived in the city of Turku. The city's population density is 718 inhabitants per square kilometre.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.turku.fi/Public/default.aspx?contentid=97662&nodeid=4907&culture=en-US&contentlan=2\", \"title\": \"www.turku.fi \\u00bb turku.fi \\u00bb Turku.info \\u00bb Publications and Reports\", \"date\": \"2008-06-25\", \"publisher\": \"turku.fi\", \"accessdate\": \"2009-05-06\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20110716095845/https://www.turku.fi/Public/default.aspx?contentid=97662&nodeid=4907&culture=en-US&contentlan=2\"}\n83.1% of Turku's population speak Finnish as their native language, while 5.4% speak Swedish. The next most widely spoken languages are Russian (1.6%), Arabic (1.4%), Kurdish (1%), Albanian (0.8%), Estonian (0.8%) and Somali (0.8%). 93.3% of the population are Finnish citizens, and the most sizeable minorities are from Russia, Estonia, Iraq, Iran, Albania, Sweden, Somalia, China, and Denmark. Like all other Finnish cities, Turku does not collect information about the ethnic and religious makeup of its population.[27]\n\nEconomy\nThe business district in the city's economy is centred on the Port of Turku and other service-oriented industries. The city is also a renowned high tech centre \u2013 the Turku Science Park area in Kupittaa hosts over 300 companies[citation needed] from the fields of biotechnology and information technology, as well as several institutions of higher learning that work in closely with the business sector. This cooperative element is seen as a particularly important factor with regards to the city's expected future economic development, as outlined in the Turku Strategy that is published annually by the city council.[citation needed]\nAt least the following major Finnish companies have their corporate headquarters in Turku: HKScan and Hesburger. Other major companies which have operations in Turku include Bayer, Fl\u00e4kt Woods, Meyer Werft, Orion Corporation and W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4.\nAs of June\u00a02015[update], over 280,000 people were registered as being without employment in Finland. This put June's numbers at 10.0 percent of the population, 0.8 percentage points higher than June 2014. Men's unemployment rate was 10.5 percent and women's 9.4 percent.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/unemployment_rate_at_10_every_fifth_young_person_without_work/8171703\", \"title\": \"Unemployment rate at 10%, every fifth young person without work\", \"website\": \"YLE\"}\n\nCulture\nCultural venues in Turku include several theatres, cinemas, and art galleries, and a city philharmonic orchestra. The city's cultural centre organises a number of regular events, most notably the Medieval Market in July each year. Turku is also the official Christmas city of Finland, and 'Christmas Peace' in Finland is declared on every 24 December from the Brinkkala Hall balcony. The Turku music festival and the rock festival Ruisrock (held on the island of Ruissalo) are among the oldest of its kind in Scandinavia. The city also hosts another rock festival, Down by the Laituri, and one of the largest electronic music festivals in Northern Europe, UMF{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.uudenmusiikinfestivaali.org/\", \"title\": \"www.uudenmusiikinfestivaali.org\", \"publisher\": \"www.uudenmusiikinfestivaali.org\"} (Uuden Musiikin Festivaali, \"New Music Festival\"), in addition to a vibrant nightlife, centred on the Market Square.\nThere are also numerous museums, such as the Turku Art Museum and the W\u00e4in\u00f6 Aaltonen Museum of Art. The \u00c5bo Akademi University maintains the Sibelius Museum, which is the only museum in Finland specialising in the field of music. Apart from these, there are also several historical museums that display the city's medieval period, such as the Turku Castle, which has been a functional historical museum since 1881, and the Aboa Vetus museum, built in the late 1990s over the 14th century archaeological site. The Luostarinm\u00e4ki handicrafts museum, converted from residential buildings that survived the Great Fire of Turku in 1827, was the first Scandinavian venue to receive the \"Golden Apple\" tourism award.\nTurku is European Capital of Culture in 2011, and the city council has approved numerous projects to boost the city's image in preparation for that status.\nThe Declaration of Christmas Peace has been a tradition in Finland from the Middle Ages every year, except in 1939 due to the Winter War. The declaration takes place on the Old Great Square of Turku, Finland's official 'Christmas City', at noon on Christmas Eve. The declaration ceremony begins with the hymn Jumala ompi linnamme (Martin Luther's Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott) and continues with the Declaration of Christmas Peace read from a parchment roll in Finnish and Swedish.\n\nSports\nThe city has two football teams playing at the top national level, the Veikkausliiga: FC Inter and TPS. TPS is one of the oldest football clubs in Finland. Both teams play their home matches at Veritas Stadion in the district of Kupittaa.\nHC TPS of Turku is one of the most successful teams in Finnish ice hockey history. It plays in the Finnish top league, SM-liiga. HC TPS has won the national championship 11 times, the latest being from season 2009\u20132010. Gatorade Center, formerly named HK Arena, located in the Artukainen district, is used as the venue for HC TPS games.\nThe Paavo Nurmi Marathon is an annual sporting event in Turku, named after the world-famous runner Paavo Nurmi, who was born and raised in the city.\nFinland's most successful tennis player, Jarkko Nieminen, was born and lives in the neighbouring county of Masku\nTurku Titans is a lacrosse club based in Turku with a relevantly successful history with three silver medals and one gold medal in the national lacrosse league in Finland.

Aleksi Randell has been the mayor of Turku since 2010.\nThe city council of Turku has 67 seats. Following the 2017 municipal election, the council seats are allocated in the following way: National Coalition Party 17 seats, Green League 14, Social Democrats 12, Left Alliance 12, True Finns 5, Centre Party 3, Swedish People's Party 3 and Christian Democrats 1.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://tulospalvelu.vaalit.fi/KV-2017/fi/kutulos_853.html\", \"title\": \"Turku: Tulos puolueittain ja yhteislistoittain\", \"date\": \"13 April 2017\", \"publisher\": \"Ministry of Justice\"} The current chair of the city board is Minna Arve from National Coalition Party.\nResults of the 2011 Finnish parliamentary election in Turku:\n\nTransport\nFor a city of its size, Turku has a moderate public transport network of bus routes, which is comparable to the bus network of similar-sized Tampere. The bus network is managed and supervised by the Turku City Region\u2019s Public Transport Committee (F\u00d6LI) (Finnish: Turun kaupunkiseudun joukkoliikennelautakunta, Swedish: kollektivtrafikn\u00e4mnden f\u00f6r \u00c5bo stadsregion), and is operated mainly by private companies. Bus traffic to and in the neighbouring municipalities of Kaarina, Lieto, Naantali, Raisio and Rusko are also handled by F\u00d6LI. The bus rates are the same when traveling within these municipalities.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.foli.fi/fi/tietoja-ja-ohjeita/joukkoliikennetietoa\", \"title\": \"Joukkoliikennetietoa\", \"publisher\": \"Turun kaupunkiseudun joukkoliikennelautakunta\", \"language\": \"Finnish\", \"accessdate\": \"2016-01-14\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20160110115933/http://www.foli.fi/fi/tietoja-ja-ohjeita/joukkoliikennetietoa\"}\nRail traffic to and from Turku is handled by the Finnish national carrier, VR. The number of services has fallen and only the railways towards Tampere and Helsinki are now in use. The railway stations currently used for passenger traffic are the Turku Central railway station in Pohjola, and two smaller stations in Kupittaa and the Port of Turku.\nThere is no local rail traffic at the moment, as the city's popular tram services were discontinued in 1972, and the various local railway lines to neighbouring towns and municipalities were all abolished during the late 20th century.[citation needed] However, there are plans for a light rail system in the Turku region in the near future. This system would more ably serve major suburbs of the city such as Varissuo and Runosm\u00e4ki, as well as the neighbouring cities.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.raitio.org/historia/pika/pika.htm\", \"title\": \"Raitiovaunulla Naantaliin, Kaarinaan, Runosm\\u00e4keen, Varissuolle?\", \"last\": \"Laaksonen\", \"first\": \"Mikko\", \"publisher\": \"Finnish Tramways Society\", \"language\": \"Finnish\", \"accessdate\": \"2008-07-11\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20080901225302/http://www.raitio.org/historia/pika/pika.htm\", \"work\": \"raitio.org\"}\nThe State of Finland has announced plans to support Espoo with 30% of full expenses on a new metro rail, the Regional Council of Southwest Finland is going to use this as a test case for a new light rail network in Turku.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.turunsanomat.fi/kotimaa/?ts=1,3:1002:0:0,4:2:0:1:2006-09-27,104:2:407945,1:0:0:0:0:0\", \"title\": \"Turun Sanomat\", \"date\": \"2006-09-27\", \"publisher\": \"Turunsanomat.fi\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://archive.is/20070630122159/http://www.turunsanomat.fi/kotimaa/?ts=1,3:1002:0:0,4:2:0:1:2006-09-27,104:2:407945,1:0:0:0:0:0\", \"archivedate\": \"2007-06-30\"}\nThe Turku Bus Station and the Turku Central railway station are currently located in different places. The City of Turku is planning to combine these two in a new greater station complex in the near future. This new travel center will consist of a hotel and several shopping estates. This center will connect all public transportation from commuter trains to long-distance buses.\nTurku Airport is located 8 kilometres (5 miles) to the north of the city centre, partly in the neighbouring municipality of Rusko. The airport is served by six passenger airlines, including airBaltic and SAS Scandinavian, and one cargo airline.\nThere are also daily ferry services from the Port of Turku to Sweden and the \u00c5land Islands, operated by Silja Line and Viking Line.
