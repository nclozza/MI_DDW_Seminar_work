The city is located in center of the region just north from the city of Donetsk. Avdiivka is best known for its big Avdiivka Coke Plant. Officially the town's population is 35,128\u2009(2013 est.)[1]; in January 2017 BBC News estimated that the population ranged between 16,000 and 22,000.[2]\n\nWar in Donbass\nStarting Mid-April 2014 pro-Russian separatists captured several towns in Donetsk Oblast;{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://newrepublic.com/article/117387/putin-accidentally-helping-unite-eastern-and-western-ukraine\", \"title\": \"Putin Is Accidentally Helping Unite Eastern and Western Ukraine - The New Republic\", \"accessdate\": \"9 February 2015\", \"author\": \"Leonid Ragozin\", \"work\": \"The New Republic\"}{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://en.itar-tass.com/world/735082\", \"title\": \"TASS: World - Donbass defenders put WWII tank back into service\", \"accessdate\": \"9 February 2015\", \"work\": \"TASS\"} including Avdiivka.
