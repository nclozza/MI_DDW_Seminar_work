It was formerly called Sankaranayinarkoil (\u0b9a\u0b99\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bb0\u0ba8\u0baf\u0bbf\u0ba9\u0bbe\u0bb0\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bcb\u0bb5\u0bbf\u0bb2\u0bcd). Sankarankovil is home to the Sankara Narayanar temple .\n\nHistory\nSanknarankovil is home to the Sankara Nayanar temple, which was built by Ugra Pandiyan BC 900[clarify] and houses the deity by the name Sankara Narayanan, which is half Shiva and the other half Vishnu. According to folklore, the devotees of Hari (Vishnu) and Shiva once quarreled with each other to determine which god was more powerful, until Shiva appeared as Sankaranarayanar to show his devotees that Hari and Shiva were one and the same. Thus, it is held sacred by Saivites and those Hindus who believe that Shiva and Vishnu are a single deity. Srivaishnavites of Tamil Nadu who worship Vishnu only do not accept this and hence reject the temple. The deities of the temple are Sri Sankareswarar, Gomathi Amman and Sri Sankara Narayanar. Sankarankovil is also said to be home to the deity named Avudai Ambal.\nIn older times, the city was called as Sankaranayinarkoil. It is also noted for the \"Adi Thabasu\" festival.\nThe general belief is that the Holy Sand \"Puttrumann\" (Puttru = Ant Hill, Mann = Sand) that one gets from this temple is capable of curing all the diseases. Devotees believe that Sankarankovil's Nagachunai (sacred tank) have been dug by serpent kings named Paduman and Sangam which has a miraculous power to heal those who bath there. Once, a \"Devan\" (Angel) called \"Manikkeerivan\" was cursed by the goddess Parvathi. Because of which, he had to come to earth and work as gardener in a beautiful garden. One day while he was clearing a snake pit, the snake tail was also cut. He found a Sivalingam next to the snake. He went and informed about this to his king \"Ugra Pandiyan\". The king considered it to be the god's wish to stay there and constructed the temple and a city around it.\nThe snake pit (Ant Hill) is called \"Vanmeekam\" (Tamil: \u0bb5\u0ba9\u0bcd\u0bae\u0bc0\u0b95\u0bae\u0bcd). Hence the deity Sri Sankaralingar is also called \"Vanmeeganadhar\" (Tamil: \u0bb5\u0ba9\u0bcd\u0bae\u0bc0\u0b95\u0ba8\u0bbe\u0ba4\u0bb0\u0bcd)\nThe town is known in Tamil Nadu for its sheep-based Sankarankovil Biryani (\u0b9a\u0b99\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bb0\u0ba9\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bcb\u0bb5\u0bbf\u0bb2\u0bcd \u0baa\u0bbf\u0bb0\u0bbf\u0baf\u0bbe\u0ba3\u0bbf).[citation needed]\n\nEducation\nIn 2018, the Government announced that Sankarankovil will be a new educational district.[citation needed]\nThe city has several educational institutions:\n\nPolitics\nSankarankovil (State Assembly Constituency) is a part of Tenkasi (Lok Sabha constituency).{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url \": \"http://archive.eci.gov.in/se2001/background/S22/TN_ACPC.pdf\", \"title \": \"List of Parliamentary and Assembly Constituencies\", \"accessdate \": \"13 October 2008\", \"work \": \"Tamil Nadu\", \"publisher \": \"Election Commission of India\", \"urlstatus \": \"dead\", \"archiveurl \": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20060504185928/http://archive.eci.gov.in/se2001/background/S22/TN_ACPC.pdf\"}\nElections contested:\n\nDemographics\nAccording to 2011 census, Sankarankoil had a population of 70, 574 with a sex-ratio of 1,012 females for every 1,000 males, much above the national average of 929.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/censusinfodashboard/index.html\", \"title\": \"Census Info 2011 Final population totals\", \"year\": \"2013\", \"publisher\": \"Office of The Registrar General and Census Commissioner, Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India\"} A total of 5,660 were under the age of six, constituting 2,867 males and 2,793 females.
