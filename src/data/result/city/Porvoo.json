It is one of the six medieval towns in Finland, first mentioned as a city in texts from the 14th century. Porvoo is the seat of the Swedish-speaking Diocese of Borg\u00e5 of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland.\nThe Porvoo Old Town is a popular tourist destination, known for its well-preserved 18th and 19th century buildings and 15th century cathedral, the Porvoo Cathedral. The Old Town together with Porvoonjoki River Valley is recognized as historically and culturally significant as one of the National landscapes of Finland.\nThe municipality's official languages are Finnish and Swedish. In 2014, 64.6% of the population spoke Finnish as their native language, while 30.1% were Swedish speakers. 5.4% had a different native language.\nPorvoo's neighbouring municipalities are Askola, Loviisa, Myrskyl\u00e4, Pornainen, and Sipoo.\n\nEtymology\nThe town received its name from a Swedish medieval fortress near the river Porvoonjoki, which flows through the town. The name Porvoo is the Fennicised version of the Swedish name (Borg\u00e5) and its parts of borg, meaning \"castle\", and \u00e5, \"river\".{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.katajala.net/keskiaika/suomi/kaupungit.html\", \"title\": \"Keskiaika - Suomen kaupungit keskiajalla\", \"website\": \"Katajala.net\", \"accessdate\": \"24 December 2017\"}\n\nHistory\nThe area of Porvoo has been inhabited since the Stone Age.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"displayauthors\": \"etal\", \"year\": \"1992\", \"title\": \"Suomalainen tietosanakirja, osa 6\", \"publisher\": \"Weilin+G\\u00f6\\u00f6s ja Almagest Oy\", \"isbn\": \"951-35-4644-6\", \"last\": \"Pertti Vihtaranta\"} In pre-historic times, the river Porvoonjoki was a route of commerce for Finnish tribal Tavastians who primarily inhabited the inland regions. The Tavastians also had some permanent settlements in the area, such as the village of Hattula (later Str\u00f6msberg), which was named after an inland Tavastian village. The original name of the river Porvoonjoki was possibly Kukinjoki. The name derives from the name of the trade vessel cog which was a common merchant ship in the Baltic Sea in medieval times. The early center of the area was Saksala, meaning \"the place of the Germans\", and deriving from the merchants who were trading in Saksala.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"1989\", \"title\": \"H\\u00e4meen H\\u00e4rk\\u00e4tie\", \"publisher\": \"Tiemuseon julkaisuja 4.

The colonisation was led by the Catholic Church and the kingdom of Sweden. The colonists originated from Svealand, and were provided with seeds, cattle and, tax exemption for four years.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"2010\", \"title\": \"Ruotsin it\\u00e4maa\", \"location\": \"Helsinki\", \"publisher\": \"Svenska litteraturs\\u00e4llskapet i Finland\", \"pages\": \"132\\u2013134\", \"last\": \"Tarkiainen\", \"first\": \"Kari\"}\nPorvoo was first mentioned in documents in the early 14th century, and it was given city rights around 1380, although according to some sources the city was founded in 1346. The old city of Porvoo was formally disestablished and the new city of Porvoo founded in 1997, when the city of Porvoo and the rural municipality of Porvoo were consolidated.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://matkailu.porvoo.fi/fi/yleista_porvoosta\", \"title\": \"Yleist\\u00e4 Porvoosta\", \"last\": \"Jaakkola\", \"first\": \"Marianne\", \"date\": \"2007-11-19\", \"publisher\": \"City of Porvoo\", \"location\": \"Porvoo\", \"language\": \"Finnish\", \"accessdate\": \"7 January 2009\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20090201151343/http://matkailu.porvoo.fi/fi/yleista_porvoosta\", \"archivedate\": \"1 February 2009\", \"df\": \"dmy-all\"} When Sweden lost the city of Viborg to Russia in 1721, the episcopal see was moved to Porvoo. At this time, Porvoo was the second largest city in Finland.\nIn 1760, roughly two thirds of all buildings in Porvoo burned to the ground in a conflagration. During rebuilding, the city planning wasn't altered, instead new buildings were built upon the existing medieval foundations.\nAfter the conquest of Finland by Russian armies in 1808, Sweden had to cede Finland to Russia in 1809 (the Treaty of Fredrikshamn). The Diet of Porvoo in 1809 was a landmark in the History of Finland. The Tsar Alexander I confirmed the new Finnish constitution (which was essentially the Swedish constitution from 1772), and made Finland an autonomous Grand Duchy.\nThe Porvoo Common Statement is a report issued at the conclusion of theological conversations by official representatives of four Anglican churches and eight Nordic and Baltic Lutheran churches in 1989\u20131992. It established the Porvoo Communion, so named after the Porvoo Cathedral where the Eucharist was celebrated on the final Sunday of the conversations leading to the Statement.\n\nOld Town\nThe town is famed for its \"Old Town\" (Gamla Stan in Swedish), a dense medieval street pattern with predominantly wooden houses from the 17th and 18th centuries. The Old Town came close to being demolished in the 19th century by a new urban plan for the city, but the plan was cancelled due to a popular resistance headed by Count Louis Sparre. With the need for growth, a plan was envisioned for a new town built adjacent to the Old Town, following a grid plan, but with houses also built of wood.\nThe central point of the old town is the medieval, stone and brick Porvoo Cathedral. The cathedral gave its name to the Porvoo Communion, an inter-church agreement between a number of Anglican and Lutheran denominations. The cathedral is reminiscent of similarly aged churches across Finland, such as the Church of St. Lawrence, Vantaa, as they were designed by the same person, the anonymous German architect Pernajan mestari. The cathedral was damaged by fire on 29 May 2006; the roof was totally destroyed but the interior is largely intact. A drunken youth had started a fire at the church, unaware of recent tarwork and nearby tar containers, accidentally causing a large conflagration. He was later sentenced to a short prison term and restitutions of 4.3 million euro.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.kirkkojakaupunki.fi/uutiset/rikos-ja-rangaistus\", \"title\": \"Archived copy\", \"accessdate\": \"2011-07-01\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20120315113713/http://www.kirkkojakaupunki.fi/uutiset/rikos-ja-rangaistus\", \"archivedate\": \"15 March 2012\", \"df\": \"dmy-all\"}\nThe red-coloured wooden storage buildings on the riverside are a proposed UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Old Town is a significant source of tourism in the area. Visitors to the capital Helsinki can embark on day trips to visit the older city. The Old Town also hosts various events, such as an annual Christmas market.\n\nLater developments\nBy the end of the 20th century, there was pressure to develop the essentially untouched western side of the river. There was concern that growth would necessitate the construction of a second bridge across the river into the town, thus putting further strain on the aging wooden town. An architectural competition was held in 1990, the winning entry of which proposed building the second bridge. Plans for the western side of the river have progressed under the direction of architect Tuomas Siitonen, and both a vehicle bridge and a pedestrian bridge have been built. The design for new housing is based on a typology derived from the old storehouses on the opposite side of the river. Yet another new development entails the construction of a large business park called King's Gate (Finnish: Kuninkaanportti, Swedish: Kungsporten), which is under construction.\nThe Porvoo railway station does not have a regular train service, but special museum trains from Kerava (either with steam locomotives or former VR diesel railcars from the 1950s) operate on summer weekends.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.helsinkiww.net/pmr/eng/time2009.html\", \"title\": \"Kerava-Porvoo Museum Train Timetable Summer 2009\", \"publisher\": \"Porvoo Museum Railway Society\", \"accessdate\": \"14 October 2009\"}\n\nSuomenkyl\u00e4\nSuomenkyl\u00e4 (Swedish: Finnby) is a village north of the centre of Porvoo and beside the Porvoo river. Suomenkyl\u00e4 has an old school founded by Johannes Linnankoski in 1898. The village of Suomenkyl\u00e4 also has two burial places from the Bronze Age.\n\nKerkkoo\nKerkkoo (Swedish: Kerko) is a village north of the centre of Porvoo and beside the Porvoo river. It has an active school that is over 100 years old. In the village of Kerkkoo, archeologists and townspeople found a stone axe from the Bronze Age.\n\nSports\nThe local team Borg\u00e5 Akilles plays the sport of bandy, in the highest division, Bandyliiga, and has become Finnish champions twice.\nSami Hyypi\u00e4, a former football player for Liverpool and the Finnish national team, originated from Porvoo.\nLauri Happonen, better known as Cyanide, a retired League of Legends professional player, is from Porvoo.\n\nTransport\nPorvoo is on the route of the E18 road from Helsinki to St Petersburg. It is currently the largest Finnish municipality without scheduled railway services, since passenger rail services to Porvoo ended in 1981 and freight services in 1990, however proposals exist to link Porvoo to the rail network as part of a new rail line from Helsinki to Kouvola via a tunnel between Pasila and Helsinki Airport.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.railjournal.com/regions/europe/helsinki-kouvola-direct-link-not-economically-viable/\", \"title\": \"Helsinki \\u2013 Kouvola direct link &quot;not economically viable&quot;\", \"date\": \"5 April 2019\", \"website\": \"International Rail Journal\"}\n\nPolitics\nResults of the 2015 Finnish parliamentary election in Porvoo:\nDistribution of the city council seats following the 2012 Finnish municipal elections:\n\nIn media\nIn the 1967 British-American espionage film Billion Dollar Brain, a small part of the plot takes place in Riga, the capital of Latvia, which is actually filmed in Porvoo.[14] Also the 1997 American film The Jackal features scenes depicting Russia, which are partly shot in Porvoo.[15][16]\n\nTwin towns \u2014 sister cities\nPorvoo is twinned with the following cities:{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.porvoo.fi/fi/yleistietoa/ystavyyskuntatoiminta\", \"title\": \"The sister cities of Porvoo\", \"publisher\": \"Porvoo City\", \"language\": \"Finnish\", \"accessdate\": \"5 March 2011\"}\n",
