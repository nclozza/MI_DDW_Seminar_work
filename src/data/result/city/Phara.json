Thus, Phara could be one of the small islands between Leukada and Ithaca or be located on the coast of Acarnania in the perea of Leukada. If this interpretation of the text of the Periplus of Pseudo-Scylax is accepted, it would have to be classified as an unlocated polis of Acarnania. \n\nSources\nCoordinates: 38\u00b038\u203219\u2033N 20\u00b036\u203221\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff38.638652\u00b0N 20.605863\u00b0E\ufeff / 38.638652; 20.605863\n\n",
