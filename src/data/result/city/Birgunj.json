It lies 135\u00a0km (84\u00a0mi) south of the capital Kathmandu, attached in the north to Raxaul in the border of the Indian state of Bihar.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.cgibirgunj.org/page/detail/1\", \"title\": \"ABOUT BIRGUNJ\", \"website\": \"www.cgibirgunj.org\", \"accessdate\": \"2017-07-04\"} As an entry point to Nepal from Patna and Kolkata, it is known as the \"Gateway to Nepal\". The town has significant economic importance for Nepal as most of the trade with India is via Birgunj and the Indian town of Raxaul. Tribhuvan Highway links Birgunj to Nepal's capital, Kathmandu. Birganj was one of the first three municipalities formed during the rule of Prime Minister Mohan Shumsher Jang Bahadur Rana. It was declared a Metropolitan City on 22 May 2017 along with Biratnagar and Pokhara. Birgunj is currently the second largest city in the Terai region of Nepal after Biratnagar and Birgunj is the sixth most populated metropolis of the nation.\n\nEtymology\nBirgunj was established as a conglomerate of several villages in and around Gahawa Mai Temple. Gahawa Mai Temple remains the epicenter of the town. The settlement was named after the Rana Prime Minister Bir Shamsher, thus acquiring the name Birgunj.\n\nAncient\nBefore the establishment of Birgunj, the main center of Parsa district was Alau, Nepal.In July 1959 From Sugauli King Rajendra Bikram Shah has a history of setting up a military camp in Alau of Parsa district.[2]\nBirgunj was founded in 1897 by 11th Rana Prime Minister Bir Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana; the ancient name was Gahawa. Before the establishment of Birgunj Bazar, the surrounding villages Baghi, Alau, Barewa, Kalaiya, Prasauni, Inaruwa, Chhapkaiya were existed.To establish Birgunj Bazar in a forest covered area, Bir Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana appointed his trusted duo Siddhvir Mathema and Dhadjavir Mathema (two brothers) respectively in Birgunj as the ruler of Mal Ada and Kath Mal Ada. In this connection, Siddhvir Mathema distributed free land and timber and provided cash assistance to the homeowners in Birgunj. The act had subsequently required Siddhvir Mathema to pay the death penalty.\nAfter the dealth of Bir Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana, Dev Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana became Prime Minister, but within three months Chandra Shumsher Jang Bahadur Rana had driven Dev Shamsher and made himself Prime Minister. The people of Late Bir Shamsher Rana and Dev Shamsher Rana did not tolerate Chandra Shamsher Rana. Bir Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana'special man Siddhivir Mathema, was accused of conducting an inspection of a reservoir treaty and carrying out three lakh irregularities on his forehead. When Siddhivir showed the calculations he had spent on setting up Birganj Bazar, he was declared invalid and an order was issued to pay the money immediately.After answering that he could not pay for what he did, As a punishment,the signboard was stick on his chest and move it around the market. The verbal verdict of the death sentence was decided to cut off and kill. After hearing about verbal of dealth sentence to Mathema who worked day and night without eating to establish Birgunj Bazar, Late Bir Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana's wife has paid 3 lakh and rescued Mathema from the death penalty.\nChandra Shamsher also wanted to displace Birganj Bazar, which his brother had established.He wanted to remove the Birgunj bazaar from there and set it in Rautahat.According to the move to displace the market, In 1959, it raided the main market from Raxaul to Birgunj and extended the rail line service to Amalekhganj. From the link, the train used to run around the houses, exploding and terrorizing the residents. Later, the rail link was moved to the east of the market (outside the market).The Raxaul city in India, which is currently connected to Birgunj as the main gateway to Nepal, was not established. At that time Indian trains operated only till Sugauli.[3]\n\nModern\nOn 18 May 2006, the parliament of Nepal declared that the country would become a secular state. This led to unrest by Hindu fundamentalist groups across Nepal; the town of Birgunj was forced to close for nearly two years and was disturbed for more than 10 years .[4]\n\nDemographics\nAccording to the 2011 Census, Birgunj had a population of 133,238.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.geohive.com/cntry/nepal.aspx\", \"title\": \"Nepal population statistics\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20150704051158/http://www.geohive.com/cntry/nepal.aspx\", \"archivedate\": \"2015-07-04\"} It is the second biggest city in Terai and the fifth biggest city in Nepal after Kathmandu, Pokhara, Lalitpur, and Biratnagar.

This was the first sugar mill established in the public sector. Later on, this mill was liquidated due to heavy losses.\nBirgunj is a major business centre of Nepal, especially for trade with India. Almost all trade with India occurs through this route. The Indian border town of Raxaul has become one of the busiest towns for heavy transportation due to high trade volume.With a large number of industries set on the Birgunj-Pathlaiya industrial corridor, Birgunj produces a wide range of products such as pharmaceuticals, textiles, vegetable ghee, plastic, steel, plastic, cigarettes, aluminium, among others.
