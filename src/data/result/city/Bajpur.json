It is an affluent town, mainly due to large agricultural estates. It was initially, like most of the area which forms present day Udham Singh Nagar District, a part of the Terai, and was gradually transformed into arable land by migrants from Punjab. Most of the early settlers were those rendered homeless by the Partition of India in 1947.\nIt was in Bajpur that India's first co-operative sugar mill went into production on 16 February 1959.[citation needed]\nWebsite: https://www.bazpur.com\n\nDemographics\nAs of 2001[update] India census,{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.censusindia.net/results/town.php?stad=A&state5=999\", \"title\": \"Census of India 2001: Data from the 2001 Census, including cities, villages and towns  (Provisional)\", \"accessdate\": \"2008-11-01\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20040616075334/http://www.censusindia.net/results/town.php?stad=A&state5=999\", \"archivedate\": \"2004-06-16\"} Bazpur had a population of 21,782.
