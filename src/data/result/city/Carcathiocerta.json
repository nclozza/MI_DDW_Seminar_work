It was the first capital of Sophene until Arsames I founded the new capital Arshamshat around 230 BCE. The Seleucid king Antiochus IV Epiphanes renamed the city into Epiphania.[citation needed] Strabo in his Geography, calls it \"The royal city of Sophene\".[1] It was assigned to the late Roman province of Mesopotamia.[2] It also bore the names Artagigarta, Baras, Basileon Phrourion, and Ingila.[3] Under the name Ingila, it became a bishopric; no longer the seat of a residential bishop, it remains a titular see of the Roman Catholic Church.[4]\nIts site is located at E\u011fil in Asiatic Turkey.[3][2]\n\nReferences\nCoordinates: 38\u00b014\u203226\u2033N 40\u00b004\u203258\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff38.2405025\u00b0N 40.0827385\u00b0E\ufeff / 38.2405025; 40.0827385\n",
