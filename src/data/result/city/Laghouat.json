Others of the same origins to this region established a village called \u201cBen Bouta\u201d as tribes of Arab D'wawoda and Awlad Bouziane settled in the region.\nLaghouat was subject to Ottoman Algeria sometimes as part of the Ottoman Empire at that time, then it was shared by two warring groups from the sons of \u201cSargins\u201d with Berber origins and the \u201cAlliance\u201d clans of Arab descent until it was taken over by France in 1852 and its unity then recovered by Algeria in 1962.
