According to the 2014 census, Abidjan's population was 4.7 million, which is 20 percent of the overall population of the country, and this also makes it the sixth most populous city proper in Africa, after Lagos, Cairo, Kinshasa, Dar es Salaam, and Johannesburg. A cultural crossroads of West Africa, Abidjan is characterised by a high level of industrialisation and urbanisation.\nThe city expanded quickly after the construction of a new wharf in 1931, followed by its designation as the capital city of the then-French colony in 1933. Abidjan remained the capital of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire after its independence from France in 1960. The completion of the Vridi Canal in 1951 enabled Abidjan to become an important sea port. In 1983, the city of Yamoussoukro was designated as the official political capital of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. However, almost all political institutions and foreign embassies continue to be located in Abidjan.\nBecause Abidjan is also the largest city in the country and the centre of its economic activity, it has officially been designated as the \"economic capital\" of the country. The Abidjan Autonomous District, which encompasses the city and some of its suburbs, is one of the 14 districts of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire.\n\nGeography\nAbidjan lies on the south-east coast of the country, on the Gulf of Guinea. The city is located on the \u00c9bri\u00e9 Lagoon. The business district, Le Plateau, is the center of the city, along with Cocody, Deux Plateaux (the city's wealthiest neighborhood and a hub for diplomats), and  Adjam\u00e9, a slum on the north shore of the lagoon. Treichville and Marcory lie to the south, Attecoube, Locodjro, Abobo Doume and Yopougon to the west, and  \u00cele Boulay is located in the middle of the lagoon. Further south lies Port Bou\u00ebt, home to the airport and main seaport. Abidjan is located at 5\u00b025\u2032 North, 4\u00b02\u2032 West (5.41667, \u22124.03333).{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://earth-info.nga.mil/gns/html/cntry_files.html\", \"title\": \"GNS: Country Files\", \"publisher\": \"Earth-info.nga.mil\", \"accessdate\": \"28 March 2011\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20110509082929/http://earth-info.nga.mil/gns/html/cntry_files.html\", \"archivedate\": \"9 May 2011\", \"df\": \"dmy\"}\n\nClimate\nAbidjan experiences a tropical wet and dry climate, according to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Aw). Abidjan has nonconsecutive rainy seasons (precipitation above 60 millimetres (2.4\u00a0in) with a long rainy season from March to July and a short rainy season from September to December, and three dry months (January, February and August). Precipitation is abundant during the summer months, except for August, due to activation of the Benguela Current, which reduces the precipitation total throughout the month.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url \": \"http://oceancurrents.rsmas.miami.edu/atlantic/benguela.html\", \"title \": \"The Benguela Current\", \"publisher \": \"Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative (GoMRI) and Consortium for Advanced Research on Transport of Hydrocarbons in the Environment (CARTHE)\", \"accessdate \": \"8 November 2016\", \"archiveurl \": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20160507192952/http://oceancurrents.rsmas.miami.edu/atlantic/benguela.html\", \"archivedate \": \"7 May 2016\", \"urlstatus \": \"live\"} The Benguela Current also lowers the mean temperature during August, making it the coolest month of the year, averaging 24.5\u00a0\u00b0C (76.1\u00a0\u00b0F). Abidjan has two additional dry months (January and February). Abidjan is generally humid, with average relative humidity above 80% throughout the year.\n\nTerritorial divisions\nAbidjan is composed of northern Abidjan and southern Abidjan. Each has ten formal boroughs, or communes, each being run by a mayor.\n\nSuburbs\nTowns near Abidjan include Jacqueville, Grand-Lahou and Dabou in the west; Sikensi, Tiassal\u00e9, Agboville, Adzop\u00e9 and Al\u00e9p\u00e9 in the north; and Grand-Bassam to the east.\nThe towns (or sub-prefectures) of Anyama, Bingerville, Brofodoum\u00e9 and Songon are within the Abidjan Department, which is co-extensive with the autonomous district.\n\nEtymology\nAccording to oral tradition of the Tchaman as reported in the Encyclopedic Dictionary of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire,[14] the name \"Abidjan\" results from a misunderstanding. Legend states that an old man carrying branches to repair the roof of his house met a European explorer who asked him the name of the nearest village. The old man did not speak the language of the explorer, and thought that he was being asked to justify his presence in that place. Terrified by this unexpected meeting, he fled shouting \"min-chan m'bidjan\", which means in the \u00c9bri\u00e9 language: \"I just cut the leaves.\" The explorer, thinking that his question had been answered, recorded the name of the locale as Abidjan.\nA slightly different and less elaborate version of the legend: When the first colonists asked a native man the name of the place, the man misunderstood and replied \"M'bi min djan\": \"I've just been cutting leaves\".{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.statoids.com/uci.html\", \"title\": \"C\\u00f4te d'Ivoire Regions\", \"publisher\": \"Statoids.com\", \"accessdate\": \"28 March 2011\", \"urlstatus\": \"live\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20110427104110/http://www.statoids.com/uci.html\", \"archivedate\": \"27 April 2011\"}\n\nColonial era\nAbidjan was originally a small Atchan fishing village. In 1896, following a series of deadly yellow fever epidemics, French colonists who had initially settled in Grand-Bassam decided to move to a safer place and in 1898 chose the current location of Abidjan.[16]\nIn 1903 it officially became a town.[17]{\"citetype\": \"encyclopedia\", \"editorlast\": \"Hoiberg\", \"editorfirst\": \"Dale H.\", \"encyclopedia\": \"Encyclop\\u00e6dia Britannica\", \"title\": \"Abidjan\", \"url\": \"https://archive.org/details/newencyclopaedia2009ency/page/32\", \"edition\": \"15th\", \"year\": \"2010\", \"publisher\": \"Encyclop\\u00e6dia Britannica Inc.\", \"volume\": \"I: A-ak Bayes\", \"location\": \"Chicago, IL\", \"isbn\": \"978-1-59339-837-8\", \"pages\": \"[https://archive.org/details/newencyclopaedia2009ency/page/32 32]\", \"urlaccess\": \"registration\"} The settlers were followed by the colonial government, created in 1899. But then nearby Bingerville became the capital of the French colony, from 1900 until 1934.\nThe future Abidjan, situated on the edge of the lagoon n'doup\u00e9 (\"the lagoon in hot water\"), offered more land and greater opportunities for trade expansion. The wharf in Petit Bassam (now Port-Bouet) south of town quickly overtook the wharf of Grand-Bassam in importance, and became the main point of economic access to the colony. In 1904, the rail terminus was located in the Port-Bouet area of Abidjan.{\"citetype\": \"encyclopedia\", \"editorlast\": \"Hoiberg\", \"editorfirst\": \"Dale H.\", \"encyclopedia\": \"Encyclop\\u00e6dia Britannica\", \"title\": \"Abidjan\", \"url\": \"https://archive.org/details/newencyclopaedia2009ency/page/32\", \"edition\": \"15th\", \"year\": \"2010\", \"publisher\": \"Encyclop\\u00e6dia Britannica Inc.\", \"volume\": \"I: A-ak Bayes\", \"location\": \"Chicago, IL\", \"isbn\": \"978-1-59339-837-8\", \"pages\": \"[https://archive.org/details/newencyclopaedia2009ency/page/32 32]\", \"urlaccess\": \"registration\"} Starting in 1904, when Bingerville was not yet complete, Abidjan became the main economic hub of the colony of Ivory Coast and a prime channel for distributing products to the European hinterland, particularly through the Lebanese community, which was increasing in importance.\nHenri de Foug\u00e8res\u00a0[fr] became governor of French Sudan in 1924, and remained governor until his death in 1931. One of the main streets of Abidjan still bears his name.\nIn 1931, Plateau and what would become Treichville were connected by a floating bridge, more or less where the Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny Bridge stands today. The year 1931 also saw addresses begin to be assigned to the streets of Abidjan for the first time. The addressing project was temporarily concluded in 1964, under the leadership of Mayor Konan Kanga, then badly redone American-style in 1993.\nAbidjan became the third capital of Ivory Coast by a 1934 decree, following Grand-Bassam and Bingerville.{\"citetype\": \"encyclopedia\", \"editorlast\": \"Hoiberg\", \"editorfirst\": \"Dale H.\", \"encyclopedia\": \"Encyclop\\u00e6dia Britannica\", \"title\": \"Abidjan\", \"url\": \"https://archive.org/details/newencyclopaedia2009ency/page/32\", \"edition\": \"15th\", \"year\": \"2010\", \"publisher\": \"Encyclop\\u00e6dia Britannica Inc.\", \"volume\": \"I: A-ak Bayes\", \"location\": \"Chicago, IL\", \"isbn\": \"978-1-59339-837-8\", \"pages\": \"[https://archive.org/details/newencyclopaedia2009ency/page/32 32]\", \"urlaccess\": \"registration\"} Several villages in Tchaman were then deserted. The leader of the Tchaman community can still be found in Adjame (\"center\" or \"meeting\" in Tchaman), north of the Plateau.\nSouth of the Plateau district (the current central district of the city of Abidjan), the village of Dugbeo was moved across the lagoon to Anoumabo, \"the forest of fruit bats\", which became the neighborhood of Treichville (now known as Commikro, city of clerks). Treichville was renamed in 1934, in honour of Marcel Treich-Lapl\u00e9nie (1860\u20131890), the first explorer of the Ivory Coast and its first colonial administrator, considered its founder. Instead of Dugbeyo, is the current Treich-Lapl\u00e9nie Avenue, the bus station and water lagoon buses in Plateau, and the Avenue Charles de Gaulle (commonly called Rue du Commerce).\nThe city was laid out like most colonial towns, on a grid plan. Le Plateau (\"m'brato\" in Tchaman) were inhabited by settlers. In the north, the city was inhabited by the colonized. The two zones were separated by the Gallieni Military Barracks, where now there is the current courthouse.\nNear the port, originally named Boulevard de Marseille, settlers became defensive and stole a street sign of a famous street of Marseille renamed the street Canebi\u00e8re, a sand track. This is the legend behind the first Blohorn oil mills, in Cocody and a racetrack was built in the south of the city.\nIn Le Plateau in the 1940s, the Bardon Park Hotel was built, the first air-conditioned hotel working in francophone Africa.\nAbidjan's lagoon became connected to the sea once the 15m-deep Vridi\u00a0[fr] canal was completed in 1950.{\"citetype\": \"encyclopedia\", \"editorlast\": \"Hoiberg\", \"editorfirst\": \"Dale H.\", \"encyclopedia\": \"Encyclop\\u00e6dia Britannica\", \"title\": \"Abidjan\", \"url\": \"https://archive.org/details/newencyclopaedia2009ency/page/32\", \"edition\": \"15th\", \"year\": \"2010\", \"publisher\": \"Encyclop\\u00e6dia Britannica Inc.\", \"volume\": \"I: A-ak Bayes\", \"location\": \"Chicago, IL\", \"isbn\": \"978-1-59339-837-8\", \"pages\": \"[https://archive.org/details/newencyclopaedia2009ency/page/32 32]\", \"urlaccess\": \"registration\"} Soon Abidjan became the financial center of West Africa.

The axis south of Treichville, towards the international airport and the beaches, became the heart of European and middle-class Abidjan. The city saw considerable population growth in the decades following independence, expanding from 180,000 inhabitants in 1960 to 1,269,000 in 1978.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.blackpast.org/gah/abidjan-cote-divoire-1903\", \"title\": \"Abidjan, C\\u00f4te d'Ivoire (1903-    ) {{!}} The Black Past: Remembered and Reclaimed\", \"website\": \"www.blackpast.org\", \"accessdate\": \"2016-12-01\", \"urlstatus\": \"live\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20161202035609/http://www.blackpast.org/gah/abidjan-cote-divoire-1903\", \"archivedate\": \"2 December 2016\"} Abidjan's skyline dates back to the economic prosperity of this period.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.worldportsource.com/ports/review/CIV_Port_of_Abidjan_1422.php\", \"title\": \"Port of Abidjan\", \"website\": \"World Port Source\", \"accessdate\": \"2016-12-01\", \"urlstatus\": \"live\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20160605071256/http://worldportsource.com/ports/review/CIV_Port_of_Abidjan_1422.php\", \"archivedate\": \"5 June 2016\"}\nNew districts such as the upmarket Cocody were founded during this period; built to a large extent in a colonial style, Cocody has since become home to C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire's wealthy classes as well as expatriates and foreign diplomats. The district is home to the embassy of France, Hotel Ivoire (which for a long time, was the only African hotel to have a skating rink), and, since 2009, the largest U.S. embassy in West Africa.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"title\": \"Massive New US Embassy Opens in Ivory Coast\", \"url\": \"http://www.voanews.com/a/a-13-2005-07-12-voa68-66931712/264223.html\", \"urlstatus\": \"live\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20161202040418/http://www.voanews.com/a/a-13-2005-07-12-voa68-66931712/264223.html\", \"archivedate\": \"2 December 2016\", \"accessdate\": \"2016-12-01\", \"newspaper\": \"VOA\"}\nConstruction on St. Paul's Cathedral, designed by Italian architect Aldo Spirito, began with the 1980 groundbreaking by Pope John Paul II and was completed in 1985. From the 1980s, Abidjan's fortunes declined as a result of negligence on the part of officials as well as corruption and general degradation. In 1983, the village of Yamoussoukro became the new political capital of Ivory Coast under the leadership of President F\u00e9lix Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny, who was born in Yamoussoukro.\nFrom 2002 to 2007 and especially from 2010 to 2011, Abidjan suffered from the consequences of the First and Second Ivorian Civil Wars. In November 2004, armed conflict broke out between French forces and Ivorian forces loyal to Laurent Gbagbo after the Ivorian Air Force attacked French peacekeepers in northern C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. After France destroyed C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire's air capabilities in retaliation, pro-Gbagbo groups staged riots and looting in Abidjan and targeted French homes, schools, and businesses.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/ivory-coast-2004.htm\", \"title\": \"Ivory Coast Conflict - 2004\", \"last\": \"Pike\", \"first\": \"John\", \"website\": \"www.globalsecurity.org\", \"accessdate\": \"2016-12-01\", \"urlstatus\": \"live\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20161202042128/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/ivory-coast-2004.htm\", \"archivedate\": \"2 December 2016\"} French peacekeepers moved into the city to calm the situation.

After the application of this new organization, Dioulo Emmanuel was elected mayor of Abidjan on 30 November 1980.\nSince 2001, the city has been divided into ten boroughs (communes). In 2011, the autonomous district of Abidjan was established by a decree instituting a system based on districts and regions instead.[27] with rural sub-prefectures in Anyama, Bingerville, Brofodoum\u00e9, and Songon. The autonomous district overlaps the Abidjan Department, which was established in 1969 and has had its current boundaries since 1998.

The municipal police and national police are separate.\nAll police are trained at the National Police Academy in the town of Cocody. They are recruited by competitive examination held by the police administration. The police include several sections, such as the BAE (Anti Riot Squad), whose base is located in Yopougon north of the city, the CRS (Republican Security Company), whose main base is located in Williamsville (Adjame) and also includes a secondary base called CRS2, which is located in zone 4 in the town of Marcory in the central capital. The Force[who?] and CECOS accompany the police.\nThe main base of the gendarmerie is at Agban (commonly Adjam\u00e9). There are others in Abobo and Kumasi, It also has a training school in Cocody and the city[clarification needed].\n\nDrugs\nSince 2000, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire has experienced a sharp rise in drug trafficking. Drug dens arise mainly in informal settlements and there has been a recent spike in demand among unemployed youth and Ivorian vagrants. The Ivorian police increasingly focus on the fight against trafficking and drug use in the district of Abidjan.

Estimates for the population of the Abidjan metropolitan area as of 2005[update] vary between 4 and 5 million inhabitants. As Abidjan is inhabited by people from a wide array of different ethnicities, French is commonly spoken in the metropolitan area, which is the fourth largest French speaking metropolitan area in the world after Paris, Montreal and Kinshasa.[citation needed] Colloquial Abidjan French has even appeared, which has a different pronunciation and some familiar words from standard French. Abidjan is recognized as one of the few areas in Africa where French (colloquial Abidjan French) is truly a native tongue,[47] along with Libreville, Gabon.[48]\n\nDemographics\nThe population of Abidjan was 4,707,404 at the 2014 census. In 2006, the metropolitan area of Abidjan had 5,060,858 inhabitants. This population increase can be attributed to the displacement since September 2002 caused by the war. Many inhabitants come to live in town for employment and safer housing.\nBy 1950, Abidjan had just exceeded a population of 50,000 (at the end of 1948). Reaching a population of a million by the end of 1975, the city grew at a rate of 10 to 12% per year, doubling every six or seven years. However, this growth underwent a sharp decline due to the crises of the 1980s and 1990s. In the last 20 years of the 20th century, the growth rate dropped to 3\u20136%. Birth rate growth was supplemented by migration, with the influx being substantial and the outflow only partly compensating the arrivals. The migration, prior to the census of 1988, contributed a growth of about 80,000 with 50,000 people from within C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, and about 30,000 from abroad per C\u00f4te d'Ivoireyear. From within C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, the migration pattern was dominated by Akan (South-east, 48%), then Mand\u00e9 (North-west, 24%) and Krou (South-west, 20%). From abroad, the migration was Burkinabes (30%), Malians (22%), Ghanaians (19%), Nigerien (11%), and Guineans (9%).{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.cicred.org/Eng/Seminars/Details/Seminars/education/ACTES/Com_Zanou.PDF\", \"title\": \"Strategies Educatives En Milieu Emigre De La Cote-D'Ivoire\", \"accessdate\": \"9 March 2014\", \"urlstatus\": \"live\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20130727150448/http://www.cicred.org/Eng/Seminars/Details/Seminars/education/ACTES/Com_Zanou.PDF\", \"archivedate\": \"27 July 2013\"} Of the non-African migration, Lebanese migration was highest, followed by European migration, with the French being largest of this latter group. All in all, people of non-African origin represent 3% of the total population of Abidjan, which remains the highest in the region.\nThe figures for 2006 estimated the population of Abidjan to 3,796,677 inhabitants, while the larger metropolitan area of Abidjan had 5,060,858 inhabitants. This population increase is mainly due to war events of September 2002. The town hosts many people in search of both jobs and secure homes.\nBefore 2014, the last population census in the country had taken place in 1998. It presented 2,877,948 inhabitants for the city.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.digital-afrique.com/villafrique1/abidjan/city/index.asp?id=056\", \"title\": \"La Ville d'Abidjan: Population\", \"website\": \"Digital Afrique\", \"language\": \"French\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20070928162745/http://www.digital-afrique.com/villafrique1/abidjan/city/index.asp?id=056\", \"archivedate\": \"28 September 2007\"} A new census was held in May 2014 and showed a population for the city of 4,707,404.\n\nLanguages\nThe traditional language of the city was Ebri\u00e9. Since independence, the official language in Abidjan and throughout C\u00f4te d'Ivoire has been French. While the official language is a formal variety standard French similar to that of Paris, the most commonly spoken form of French in Abidjan is a colloquial dialect known as fran\u00e7ais de Treichville or fran\u00e7ais de Moussa which differs from standard French in pronunciation and in some of its vocabulary. Another form of spoken French in Abidjan is Nouchi, a highly informal variety used as adolescent slang. The historical lingua franca, still spoken and understood by most of the trading population of Abidjan, is Dioula. The city hosts many Ivorians from all over the country and about sixty vernacular languages are spoken, such as Atti\u00e9, Baoul\u00e9, B\u00e9t\u00e9, and Wob\u00e9. Abidjan is surrounded by more than thirty villages where Baoul\u00e9 and \u00c9bri\u00e9 are still commonly spoken.\n\nHealth\nSome traditional medicine establishments sell traditional drugs in the street.[citation needed] There are numerous health centers, pharmacies and pharmacopoeias.[citation needed] The city has more than fifty clinics, and over sixty specialist locations (veterinary, dermatology, dental, optometry, motherhood, psychology, pediatrics, etc.)[citation needed].\n\nUrbanism and habitat\nModern districts like Plateau or Cocody have developed similar to those in Europe with the construction of large office towers and apartment buildings between the 1970s and the mid-1980s.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.emporis.com/fr/wm/ci/bu/sk/li/?id=100024&bt=5&ht=2&sro=0\", \"title\": \"Abidjan \\u2013 Immeubles de grandes hauteurs existant\", \"date\": \"15 June 2009\", \"publisher\": \"Emporis\", \"accessdate\": \"28 March 2011\", \"urlstatus\": \"live\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20110629190249/http://www.emporis.com/fr/wm/ci/bu/sk/li/?id=100024&bt=5&ht=2&sro=0\", \"archivedate\": \"29 June 2011\"}\nTraditional neighborhoods like Treichville or Marcory maintained the system of \"concessions\" where housing is adjacent to the plant and an area of several houses, within the normal organization and multi centuries-old African villages.[52]\nThe district of Cocody is also home to many single-storey wooden villas, surrounded by vast gardens of lush vegetation, fed by the heavy rains that water the city. Wealthier inhabitants constructed villas in imitation of Greek temples in this district. In addition, many houses were built on stilts on the edge of the \u00c9bri\u00e9 Lagoon. The town hall, a fine example of modernist architecture, was designed by architect Henri Chomette\u00a0[fr].\n\nProblems with urban network\nThe urban network is disrupted, as Abidjan has seen its population double every seven years since 1945. Rural people are attracted by the opportunities of the city. Abidjan represents 45% of city dwellers in the C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and 20% of the overall population. The city is by far the country's largest, dwarfing the second-largest city, Bouak\u00e9 (which had 542,082 inhabitants in 2014) as well as the political capital, Yamoussoukro (207,412 inhabitants).\n\nUrban squalor\nSince the 2006 Probo Koala toxic waste dumping incident,[53] significant efforts have been made to address waste management issues in Abidjan.

Abidjan is the economic centre of both the C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and of the whole region, including Burkina Faso and Mali; this is mainly because of its deep-water port. The road network in Abidjan (5,600\u00a0km asphalted in 1995, compared to 1,000\u00a0km in 1970), which covers the whole region, effectively increases its port activity as 50% of the business from Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger pass through it.\nAbidjan receives the bulk of the country's industrial activity; its port alone receiving 60% of ivory park industry. Abidjan has ambitions of oil-production\u2014off-shore production and especially refining and distribution. In 1995 the port received 12 million tonnes of traffic, of which 5.5\u00a0million tonnes were petroleum products.\nExports include coffee, cocoa, timber, bananas, pineapples, and manganese.{\"citetype\": \"encyclopedia\", \"editorlast\": \"Hoiberg\", \"editorfirst\": \"Dale H.\", \"encyclopedia\": \"Encyclop\\u00e6dia Britannica\", \"title\": \"Abidjan\", \"url\": \"https://archive.org/details/newencyclopaedia2009ency/page/32\", \"edition\": \"15th\", \"year\": \"2010\", \"publisher\": \"Encyclop\\u00e6dia Britannica Inc.\", \"volume\": \"I: A-ak Bayes\", \"location\": \"Chicago, IL\", \"isbn\": \"978-1-59339-837-8\", \"pages\": \"[https://archive.org/details/newencyclopaedia2009ency/page/32 32]\", \"urlaccess\": \"registration\"}\n\nBridges\nThe two-halves of the city, Northern Abidjan and Southern Abidjan, are joined by the Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny, the Charles de Gaulle and the Henri Konan B\u00e9di\u00e9 bridges. The two former bridges, built in the 1950s and 1960s respectively, are located between Treichville and Le Plateau. The G\u00e9n\u00e9ral-de-Gaulle Bridge extends over the immense Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing Boulevard which leads to the airport. Both bridges are often congested, especially during rush hour or on the occasion of police and military roadblocks.\nA third 1.5\u00a0km (0.93\u00a0mi) toll bridge and expressway, the Henri Konan B\u00e9di\u00e9 Bridge between Cocody and Marcory was completed in December 2014.

This suburban train system would link the North-West to the East and North of the city. The project extends over 25\u00a0km of railway tracks which as of 2011[update] were used by the operator Sitarail, a subsidiary company of the Bollor\u00e9 group. The infrastructural works (tracks, electrification, and civil engineers) have been estimated at 40\u00a0billion CFA francs, financed by the State of Ivory Coast and backers (World Bank and the French Development Agency). In addition, a BOT concession contract would be given to a private operator, over 20\u201330 years, to operate the network. This operator will be in charge of the acquisition of railway materials, workshop renovation and the implementation of an organisational system. The concession contract has been estimated at around 60\u00a0billion CFA francs.\n\nTourism\nAbidjan is a unique city in Africa. Its nicknames, such as \"Manhattan of the tropics\", \"Small Manhattan\" or \"Pearl of the lagoons\", explain the city's unpredictable and triumphant image. With its accommodation facilities \u2013 such as the Golf H\u00f4tel\u00a0\u2013 and sporting facilities, its lively night life, transport and communication lines as well as its impressiveness, it is the perfect city for business tourism.\nAbidjan also has beaches around the lagoon, with palm and coconut trees, in the Vridi area, which are very popular at weekends with the picturesque sight of the pineapple and coconut sellers. Nevertheless, the rip-tides which affects practically the whole of the Gulf of Guinea's coast, means that in this area swimming is not usually allowed. Generally, in Cote d'Ivoire, tourism has never really been developed as an economic industry; the country is not much of a common holiday destination.\n\nParc du Banco (Banco National Park)\nConverted in 1926, this park has 3,000 hectares and ancient \"sacred wood\" lies at the entrance to the city, in the Att\u00e9coub\u00e9 community, which has been conserved as a relic of the first forest which surrounded the lagoon in the past. A tarmaced road goes straight to the lake at the heart of the park and trails go throughout it. The park is inhabited and there are coffee and cocoa plantations.\nAt the edge of the park, a small river serves as a wash-house where the fanicos, laundry men, work after collecting the laundry from the whole of the city. It is one of the 'small jobs' which exist in Abidjan.\n\nNightlife\nOverall, the nightlife in Abidjan is considered to be one of the liveliest in the whole of Africa.\nThe district has an abundance of night-clubs, maquis, out-door areas, and go-go bars. These entertainment platforms provide a musical 'pipeline' encompassing mainly DJs, Coup\u00e9 D\u00e9cal\u00e9 and Zouglou, and, in lesser amounts, other local and international varieties.\nFormerly containing only local traditional varieties, Congolese music and Western music, Abidjan's night life has experienced a positive cultural disruption in its music since the start of the 2000s, with the arrival of Coup\u00e9 D\u00e9cal\u00e9.\nThis musical genre was introduced in 2002 by Douk Saga\u00a0[fr] and La Jet Set\u00a0[fr], with the help of Sagacit\u00e9, created a phenomenon which has not stopped spreading and reaching out to the hot nights in the capitals of the sub-region. It has given a globally identifiable cultural identity to entertainment 'made in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire'.\nThe very popular Zouglou additionally benefits \"W\u00f4y\u00f4\" spaces; furnished and dedicated so that the most famous, the Internat at Fitini's and the Lycee at Vieux Gazeur's, attract 'zouglouphiles' the whole weekend.\nTreichville, with its many maquis, discoth\u00e8ques, and jazz clubs, used to be the liveliest area in the city, but since the end of the 1990s Youpougon, Marcory, and Cocody have taken over this role.\n\nFestivals\nEach year film festivals are organised in Abidjan: The Clap-Ivoire Festival,[89] the Spanish Film Festival, the C\u00f4te d'Ivoire National Film Festial (FESNACI) \u2013 the first of which was organised in 2007,{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.lecourrierdabidjan.info/develop.asp?id=14623\", \"title\": \"Ouverture du festival\", \"publisher\": \"Lecourrierdabidjan.info\", \"accessdate\": \"28 March 2011\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20120305153844/http://www.lecourrierdabidjan.info/develop.asp?id=14623\", \"archivedate\": \"5 March 2012\", \"df\": \"dmy-all\"} the short film festival (FIMA),[91] which has been organised since 1998 by Hanni Tchelley, the Abidjan Israeli Film Festival;{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.lematindabidjan.com/visual_article.php?num_actualite=2668\", \"title\": \"Festival du cin\\u00e9ma isra\\u00e9lien d'Abidjan\", \"publisher\": \"Lematindabidjan.com\", \"accessdate\": \"28 March 2011\", \"urlstatus\": \"live\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20070713040443/http://www.lematindabidjan.com/visual_article.php?num_actualite=2668\", \"archivedate\": \"13 July 2007\"} the fourth one took place in 2006 in the Goethe Institute.\n\nAbidjan in cinema\nSeveral films depict or are devoted to the city:\n)\n\nMusic\nAbidjan is a turntable for West African music, and a major producer of musical art in Africa. The city attracts the majority of musicians from the C\u00f4te d'Ivoire mainly because of its many dance clubs, which allow artists to make their debut and express themselves, record companies and national media. Here are a few examples of the most popular artists to have made their debut in Abidjan: Alpha Blondy, A\u00efcha Kon\u00e9, the group Magic System, Meiway, and Tiken Jah Fakoly, as well as Gadji Celi, Chantal Taiba, Nayanka Bell, DJ Arafat. In the 1980s Miriam Makeba came to Abidjan when she was not allowed back to her own country, South Africa, as did the Congolese diva Tshala Muana, apostle of the Soukous style of dance.\nSince the 1990s, Abidjan has had a significant variety of musical styles being exported throughout Africa and the West. These are Zoblazo, Mapouka, Zouglou and, since 2002, the Coup\u00e9-D\u00e9cal\u00e9; the popularity and great variety of these dances make the city a kind of African dance and musical trend capital. Congo-Kinshasa formerly held this title, with rumba, soukous and then ndombolo. Abidjan is also considered the reggae capital of Africa.\nEach year, the city organises the following music festivals:\n\nMedia\nMost mass media in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire can be found in Abidjan.\n\nTelevision and radio\nThe National Council for Audio-visual Communication (CNCA) is the regulating authority of audio-visual material in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire.\nRadiodiffusion Television Ivoirienne (RTI) is the radio and television broadcasting authority for C\u00f4te d'Ivoire; it is financed by licence fees, publicity and grants. RTI has four television channels and two radio stations: La Premi\u00e8re (non-specialised), TV2, RTI Music TV, RTI Sport TV, Radio C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, and Fr\u00e9quence 2 (non-specialised radio). Radio Jam is a private radio station in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and is most listened to by young people.\nWith regards to private channels, Tam-Tam TV will be the first International C\u00f4te d'Ivoire television channel with headquarters in Abidjan, with other studios in the United States, Italy, France, Asia, the Middle East.\nThere are also several C\u00f4te d'Ivoire TV channels or radio stations available on the Internet: Africahit, Music TV, Abidjan.net TV, Bengueshow, etc.\nWith the launch in 2015 of DISCOP Africa Abidjan, the city became a hub for TV market professionals from French-speaking Africa.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://discopafrica.com/introducing-discop-africa-express/\", \"title\": \"Intro to Discop Africa Abidjan\", \"publisher\": \"discopafrica.com\", \"accessdate\": \"9 November 2015\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20150928224437/http://discopafrica.com/introducing-discop-africa-express/\", \"archivedate\": \"28 September 2015\", \"df\": \"dmy-all\"}\n\nPress\nAt the time of the single-party, a political situation which ruled over the country for 30 years like most other West African countries after independence, only one daily newspaper was distributed throughout the country: Fraternit\u00e9 Matin, from the parliamentary group PDCI-RDA, which was founded by the first president, F\u00e9lix Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny.
