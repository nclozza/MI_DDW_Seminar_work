The iron ore which is benefited is also exported to China. This town also has Steel manufacturing, Iron ore pellet manufacturer and liquid oxygen production. A large number of industries have come up in the recent past. It remains to be seen how the government's directive increasing the cost of export of raw iron ore affects the economy of Barbil town.
