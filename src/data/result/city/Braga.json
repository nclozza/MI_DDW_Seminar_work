Its area is 183.40\u00a0km2.[2] Its agglomerated urban area extends from the C\u00e1vado River to the Este River. It is the third-largest urban centre in Portugal (after Lisbon and Porto).\nIt is host to the oldest Portuguese archdiocese, the Archdiocese of Braga of the Catholic Church and it is the seat of the Primacy of the Spains. Under the Roman Empire, then known as Bracara Augusta, the settlement was the capital of the province of Gallaecia. Inside of the city there is also a castle tower that can be visited. Nowadays, Braga is a major hub for inland Northern Portugal and it is an important stop on the Portuguese Way path of the Road of St James. The city was also the European Youth Capital in 2012.[3]\n\nPre-Romans\nHuman occupation of the region of Braga dates back thousands of years, documented by vestiges of monumental structures starting in the Megalithic era. During the Iron Age, the Castro culture extended into the northwest, characterized by Bracari peoples who occupied the high ground in strategically located fortified settlements (castrum).\nThe region became the domain of the Callaici Bracarii, or Bracarenses, a Celtic{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YFR2AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA45&dq=origem+celta+braga+bracara&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjV_5aanOHXAhUHLlAKHSg2BH8Q6AEIOTAC#v=onepage&q=origem+celta+braga+bracara&f=false\", \"title\": \"Introdu\\u00e7\\u00e3o \\u00e0 Hist\\u00f3ria da L\\u00edngua e Cultura Portuguesas\", \"last\": \"Machado\", \"first\": \"Jos\\u00e9 Barbosa\", \"date\": \"1 January 2014\", \"publisher\": \"Edi\\u00e7\\u00f5es Vercial\", \"accessdate\": \"27 March 2018\"} tribe who occupied what is now northern Portugal, Galicia and Asturias in the northwest of Iberia.\n\nRoman rule\nThe Romans began their conquest of the region around 136 BC, and finished it, by pacifying the northern regions, during the reign of Emperor Augustus. The civitas of Bracara Augusta was founded in 20 BC; in the context of the administrative reorganization of these Roman acquisitions, Bracara was rededicated to the Emperor taking on the name Bracara Augusta. The city of Bracara Augusta developed greatly during the 1st century and reached its maximum extension around the 2nd century.\nTowards the end of the 3rd century, the Emperor Diocletian promoted the city to the status of capital of the administrative area Conventus bracarensis, the southwestern area of the newly founded Roman province of Gallaecia.\n\nBraga in Late Antiquity and Middle Ages\nDuring the Germanic Invasions of the Iberian Peninsula, the area was conquered by the Suebi, a Germanic people from Central Europe. In 410, the Suebi established a Kingdom in northwest Iberia covering what is present-day's Northern half of Portugal,[5] Galicia and Asturias, which they maintained as Gallaecia, and had Bracara as their capital. This kingdom was founded by Hermeric and lasted for over 150 years.By about 584, the Visigoths took over control of Gallaecia from the Suebi, and Braga was made a provincial capital.\nBraga had an important role in the Christianization of the Iberian Peninsula. The first known bishop of Braga, Paternus, lived at the end of the 4th century, although Saint Ovidius (d. 135 AD) is sometimes considered one of the first bishops of this city. In the early 5th century, Paulus Orosius (a friend of Augustine of Hippo) wrote several theological works that expounded the Christian faith. Thanks to the work of Saint Martin of Braga the Suebi in Iberia renounced the Arian and Priscillianist heresies during two synods held here in the 6th century. At the time, Martin also founded an important monastery in Dumio (Dume), and it was in Braga that the Archbishopric of Braga held their councils. As a consequence, the archbishops of Braga later claimed the title of Primate of Portugal, then a county, and for a long period, claimed supremacy over the entire Hispanic church. Yet, their authority was never accepted throughout Hispania.\nThe transition from Visigothic reigns to the Muslim conquest of Iberia was very obscure, representing a period of decline for the city. The Moors briefly captured Braga early in the 8th century, but were repelled by Christian forces under Alfonso III of Asturias in 868 with intermittent attacks until 1040 when they were definitely ousted by Ferdinand I of Le\u00f3n and Castile. As a consequence, the bishopric was restored in 1070: the first new bishop, Pedro (Peter), started rebuilding the Cathedral (which was modified many times during the following centuries).\nBetween 1093 and 1147, Braga became the residential seat of the Portuguese court. In the early 12th century, Count Henry of Portugal and bishop Geraldo de Moissac reclaimed the archbishopric seat for Braga, with power over a large area in Iberia. The medieval city developed around the cathedral, with the maximum authority in the city retained by the archbishop.\n\nBraga in the Kingdom of Portugal\nBraga as the main center of Christianity in Iberia, during the Reconquista (until the emergence of Santiago de Compostela and, later, the conquest of Toledo from the Muslims, in 1085), held a prominent stage in medieval politics, being a major contributor to the Independence of Portugal with the intervenience of the Archbishop D. Paio Mendes in the Vatican, with Pope Alexander III, which lead to the promulgation of the Bula Manifestis Probatum, in 1179, recognizing Portugal as an independent Kingdom under D. Afonso I Henriques.\nThe following centuries marked a slow decline in its prestige and influence marked by the infamous theft of Holy Relics (including those of Saint Martin of Dume) by the then Archbishop of Santiago of Compostela Gelmirez. The relics only returned to Braga in the 1960s.\nIn the 16th century, due to its distance from the coast and provincial status, Braga did not profit from the adventures associated with the Age of Portuguese Discoveries (which favoured cities like Lisbon, \u00c9vora and Coimbra, new seats for the Portuguese court). Yet, Archbishop Diogo de Sousa, who sponsored several urban improvements in the city, including the enlargement of streets, the creation of public squares and the foundation of hospitals and new churches managed to modernize the community. He expanded and remodelled the cathedral by adding a new chapel in the Manueline style, and generally turning the mediaeval town into a Renaissance city.\nA similar period of rejuvenation occurred during the 18th century, when the archbishops of the House of Braganza contracted architects like Andr\u00e9 Soares and Carlos Amarante, to modernize and rejuvenate the city; they began a series of architectural transformations to churches and civic institutions in the Baroque style, including the municipal hall, public library, the Sanctuary of Bom Jesus do Monte and many urban palaces.\nWith the invasion of French troops, during the Peninsular Wars the city was relegated, once again, to a provincial status. But, by the second half of that century, with influence from Portuguese immigrants living in Brazil, new money and tastes resulted in improvements to architecture and infrastructures.\n\nRepublic\nIn the 20th century Braga faced similar periods of growth and decline; demographic and urban pressures, from urban-to-rural migration meant that the city's infrastructures had to be improved in order to satisfy greater demands.\n\nPhysical geography\nSituated in the heart of Minho, Braga is located in a transitional region between the east and west: between mountains, forests, grand valleys, plains and fields, constructing natural spaces, moulded by human intervention. Geographically, with an area of 184 square kilometres (71\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) it is bordered in the north by the municipalities of Vila Verde and Amares, northeast and east by P\u00f3voa de Lanhoso, south and southeast with Guimar\u00e3es and Vila Nova de Famalic\u00e3o and west by the municipality of Barcelos.[6]\nThe topography in the municipality is characterized by irregular valleys, interspersed by mountainous spaces, fed by rivers running in parallel with the principal rivers. In the north it is limited by the C\u00e1vado River, in the south by terrain of the Serra dos Picos to a height of 566 metres (1,857\u00a0ft) and towards the east by the Serra dos Carvalhos to a height of 479 metres (1,572\u00a0ft), opening to the municipalities of Vila Nova de Famalic\u00e3o and Barcelos. The territory extends from the northeast to southwest, accompanying the valleys of the two rivers, fed by many of its tributaries, forming small platforms between 20 metres (66\u00a0ft) and 570 metres (1,870\u00a0ft).\nThe municipality lies between 20 metres (66\u00a0ft) and 572 metres (1,877\u00a0ft), with the urbanized centre located at approximately 215 metres (705\u00a0ft). In the north, where the municipality is marked by the Cavado, the terrain is semi-planar, the east is mountainous owing to the Serra do Carvalho 479 metres (1,572\u00a0ft), Serra dos Picos 566 metres (1,857\u00a0ft), Monte do Sameiro 572 metres (1,877\u00a0ft) and Monte de Santa Marta 562 metres (1,844\u00a0ft). Between the Serra do Carvalho and Serra dos Picos is the River Este, forming the valley of Vale d\u2019Este. Similarly, between the Serra dos Picos and Monte do Sameiro exists the plateau of Sobreposta-Pedralva. To the south and west, the terrain is a mix of mountains, plateaus and medium-size valleys, permitting the passage of the River Este, and giving birth to other confluences including the River Veiga, River Labriosca and various ravines.\n\nClimate\nBraga has a Mediterranean climate similar to other cities in the northwest Iberian Peninsula' except for having significantly hotter summer temperatures due to being some distance from the ocean: the absolute maximum is as much as 5\u00a0\u00b0C (9\u00a0\u00b0F) higher than neighbouring A Coru\u00f1a or Santiago de Compostela. The lowest recorded is \u22126.3\u00a0\u00b0C (20.7\u00a0\u00b0F). The climate of Braga is hot in summer with temperatures that can approach 45\u00a0\u00b0C (113\u00a0\u00b0F).\nThe climate is affected by the Atlantic Ocean which influences westerly winds that are channeled through the region's valleys, transporting large humid air masses. Consequently, the climate tends to be pleasant with clearly defined seasons. The air masses have the effect of maintaining the relative humidity around 80%: annual mean temperatures hover between 12.5\u00a0\u00b0C (54.5\u00a0\u00b0F) and 17.5\u00a0\u00b0C (63.5\u00a0\u00b0F). Owing to nocturnal cooling, frost usually forms frequently between three and four months of the year (about 30 days of frost annually), and annually the region receives 1,659 millimetres (65.3\u00a0in) of precipitation, with the major intensity occurring between fall/winter and spring.\n\nHuman geography\nThe municipality is densely populated, with approximately 962 inhabitants per square kilometre, equivalente to 181,474 residents (2011); it is one of the more populous territories in Portugal, as well as one of the \"younger\" markets.[8] The majority of the population concentrates in the urban area of Braga, itself, where densities are more than 10000 per square kilometre.\nThe Bracarense population consists of approximately 78954 male and 85238 female individuals, with 35% of the population less than 25 years of age, while seniors conform to 11% of the population; the working population of the municipality occupies 54% of this structure.[8] Although largely native Portuguese, other segments of the population include  Brazilians, Africans (principally from the former Portuguese colonies), Chinese and eastern European peoples, namely Ukrainians.[8]\nThe urban structure includes approximately 70,268 residences (2001), even as the typical classic representation of family only includes 51,173 members in the municipality.[8] The \"extra\" homes are primarily temporary residences, normally for students, migrant workers and professionals working in the city. There is, also, a great number of homes owned by Portuguese residents living overseas (who use the homes periodically while in Portugal) even as constant and development has attracted new growth in the population.[8] Further, the difference in resident to transitory population means that, on average, the population of Braga hovers between 174,000 and 230,000 individuals annually.[8]\nGrowth in the population, roughly 16.2% between 1991 and 2001, occurred mainly in the older suburban civil parishes, such as Nogueira (124.6%), Frossos (68.4%), Real (59.8%) and Lama\u00e7\u00e3es (50.9%).[8]\nAdministratively, the municipality is divided into 37 civil parishes (freguesias):{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://dre.pt/pdf1sdip/2013/01/01901/0000200147.pdf\", \"title\": \"Law nr. 11-A/2013, pages 552 26-28\", \"language\": \"Portuguese\", \"accessdate\": \"18 July 2014\", \"author\": \"''[[Di\\u00e1rio da Rep\\u00fablica]]''\"}\nThe city of Braga proper includes only the following urban civil parishes:[citation needed]\nThere is no formal city government, only municipal government authority, with local administration handled by the individual juntas de freguesia or civil parish councils.\n\nEconomy\nCentral Avenue in Braga\nCampo das Hortas, Braga\nThe major industries in the municipality are construction, metallurgy and mechanics, software development and web design. The computer industry is growing rapidly.\n\nTransport\nAlthough the region hosts its own airfield (Aerodromo de Braga) in Palmeira, the principal airport of note is S\u00e1 Carneiro International Airport located 50 kilometres (31\u00a0mi) away, in Porto. Access is made by public transit to the city centre (roughly 40 minutes) or Aerobus (50 minutes). Braga is serviced by both regional and high-speed rail connection to major centres in the region.\n\nArchitecture\nThe region of Braga is scattered with Neolithic, Roman, Medieval and Modernist monuments, buildings and structures attracting tourists. Although there are many examples of these structures, only the following have been classified by the Instituto de Gest\u00e3o do Patrim\u00f3nio Arquitect\u00f3nico e Arqueol\u00f3gico as National Monuments:\n\nMuseums\nIn addition, many of the district's treasures and historical artifacts are housed in several museums that are scattered throughout the city, such as:\n\nEducation\nThe city is the headquarters and main campus for the Universidade do Minho (Minho University), a public university founded in 1973. A campus of Portugal's oldest private university of Portugal, the Universidade Cat\u00f3lica Portuguesa, was also established in 1967, as well as the Escola Secund\u00e1ria S\u00e1 de Miranda (the oldest Secondary school in Braga).\nIn the late 2000s, the International Iberian Nanotechnology Laboratory also opened their international research centre in the city.\nThe Braga Pedagogical Farm is a farm dealing with animals and agriculture, welcoming extra-curricular activities from schools and visitors.\n\nSports\nBraga's football team, Sporting Clube de Braga, was founded in 1921 and play in the top division of Portuguese football, the Liga NOS, from Braga Municipal Stadium, carved out of the Monte Castro hill that overlooks the city. Braga has had considerable success in recent years, winning the Taca de Portugal for the second time in 2016 and reaching the Europa League final in 2011 which they lost to fellow Portuguese side FC Porto.\nThe Rampa da Falperra, a round of the European Hillclimb Championship, is held every year in the outskirts of the city.\nThe Circuito Vasco Sameiro and adjacent the Kart\u00f3dromo Internacional de Braga are located around the local airfield. The racing track held European Touring Car Cup events in 2009 and 2010, and the KIB has held rounds of the Karting World Championship.\n\nInternational relations\nBraga is twinned with:{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.cm-braga.pt/pt/0104/municipio/cooperacao-institucional/geminacoes\", \"title\": \"Gemina\\u00e7\\u00f5es\", \"website\": \"cm-braga.pt\", \"publisher\": \"Braga\", \"language\": \"pt\"}\n",
