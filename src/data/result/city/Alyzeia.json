In this sanctuary were some works of art by Lysippus, representing the Labours of Heracles, which a Roman general caused to be removed to Rome on account of the deserted state of the place. The remains of Alyzia are still visible in the valley of Kandili. The distance of the bay of Kandili from the ruins to Leucas corresponds with the 120 stadia which Cicero assigns for the distance between Alyzia and Leucas.[4][5][6] Alyzia is said to have derived its name from Alyzeus, a son of Icarius.[7][1] It is first mentioned by Thucydides; in 375\u00a0BCE, a naval battle was fought in the neighbourhood of Alyzia between the Athenians under Timotheus and the Lacedaemonians under Nicolochus.[8] The Athenians, says Xenophon, erected their trophy at Alyzia, and the Lacedaemonians in the nearest islands.[9] We learn from the Periplus of Pseudo-Scylax that the island immediately opposite Alyzia was called Carnus, the modern Kalamos.\nIts site is located near the modern Kandila, Xiromero.[10][11]\n\nReferences\n\u00a0This article\u00a0incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain:\u00a0Smith, William, ed.
