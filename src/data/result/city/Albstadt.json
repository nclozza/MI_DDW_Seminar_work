It is located on the Swabian  Alb mountains, about halfway between Stuttgart and Lake of Constance.\n\nGeography\nAlbstadt is spread across a variety of hills and valleys, its elevation ranges between 614\u00a0m (2,014\u00a0ft) above sea level and 966\u00a0m (3,169\u00a0ft). One valley is the river Schmiecha, a left-hand tributary of the Danube, a second valley is the river of upper Eyach, a tributary of the Neckar.\nTo Albstadt belongs also the Raichberg hill in the north, on which there is the Raichberg Transmitter and an observation tower located. South of Albstadt is the Heuberg Military Training Area.\n\nHistory\nSettlement in the region dates back to at least the Iron Age. A Hallstatt cemetery in Albstadt was excavated by amateur archaeologists in the late nineteenth century and revealed a wide range of pottery and metal artefacts. Known as the 'Degerfeld Barrow' cemetery, a substantial collection was built up by the local antiquary Hyronimus Edelmann that was eventually deposited in the British Museum.[2][3]\n\nMining\nIn former times iron ore was produced in Albstadt.  Fidel Eppler was the name of the mine-inspector. The buttress wood was bought in  Truchtelfingen and used from Lautlinger Knappen at the H\u00f6rnle area .[4] From an old 3,5\u00a0km mine in a Doggererzfl\u00f6z in Weilheim is wood in the Tuttlinger Fruchtkasten .[5] \nSteel was produced in Tuttlingen by the Schw\u00e4bische H\u00fcttenwerke in Ludwigstal, today iron brakes.\nThe districts Ebingen, Laufen, Lautlingen, Pfeffingen und Tailfingen were first mentioned in 793 in a document of the abbey St. Gallen. Ebingen received city rights around 1250 from the Hohenberg ducal family.\nAlbstadt consists of the following urban districts, which had been independent towns and merged to form Albstadt in 1975:\n\nEconomy\nMost of the textiles industry (among them Hasana J. Hakenm\u00fcller) is gone today, leaving some monuments, like Villa Haux. However, one of the world's biggest makers of industrial needles, Groz-Beckert still resides there. Other prominent local companies include Mey (knitwear), Mettler Toledo (weighing systems) and a major part of Assa Abloy security systems (Eff-Eff Brand). Ebingen also hosts the technical and computer science faculties of Albstadt-Sigmaringen University with about 3,000 students (2014).\n\nExternal links\n Media related to Albstadt at Wikimedia Commons\n",
