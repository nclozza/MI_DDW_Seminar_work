In the beginning of the 20th century the region was dominated by a subtropical forest and totally wild, except for the Road of Peabiru, used by the Portuguese to connect the Guaira region, further west, to the coast. The road existed from the 17th century, but the first reported contact with the natives of the region, the Xetas, was in the 1930s. The Xetas, a group of three or four hundred, had their own language, and were early Iron Age in culture. The group vanished after they were contacted by the British in controversial and unexplained circumstances.\nIn the 1940s the English company drew the city plan and split the region into very small farms. At this time, the city was redivided and part of the city and the areas around were sold to immigrants, mainly Italian-Brazilians and Japanese-Brazilians of second or third generation from S\u00e3o Paulo. Those immigrants were primarily poor ordinary workers in the huge coffee farms of S\u00e3o Paulo, and perceived the inexpensive land in Cianorte as their big opportunity in life. They built houses and schools, temples and businesses. The city become a municipality, which, under Brazilian laws, allows the area to extend its political structure.\nThe Municipality of Cianorte was created through the State Law no. 2.412 of July 26, 1955. Cianorte then had around 11,000 inhabitants, mostly in the countryside. The economy was based on coffee. A disastrous frost in the winter of 1975, in which temperatures dropped below zero for the first time in recorded weather, destroyed the coffee plantations. Coffee trees take around five years to start producing, and so the economy went through a terrible crisis. Population fell and businesses closed.\nThe disaster transformed the city. People opened clothing factories and shops in their garages and back yards. By the time agriculture began to recover, some of the mini-factories had grown to medium-sized companies, and the work force was already devoted to those. During the next decades some of those garage enterprises turned into huge factories that today sell clothes to the entire country, and export a significant portion to several countries. Shop owners from several states of Brazil visit Cianorte in the beginning of every season to purchase clothing, so hotels and restaurants are opened specially for them.\nLocal agriculture is now significantly diversified \u2014 coffee is only 5% of the farmland now \u2014 and other farmers plant soy, sugar cane and corn. Beef and chicken are also produced in a fairly large scale. With the factories and the agriculture doing so well, in the turn of the century the city attracted more and more immigrants from all over the country, and today the city population, business and infrastructure is growing quickly, turning Cianorte into the regional hub of part of Ivai River Valley, which includes ten smaller cities.\n\nClimate\nHumid Subtropical climate, hot summers with frequent and heavy rain (average temperatures ranging from 20\u00a0\u00b0C to 27\u00a0\u00b0C), mild winters with frequent frosts (average temperatures ranging from 14\u00a0\u00b0C to 23\u00a0\u00b0C).\n\nEconomy\nMain Economical Activities  \nCianorte is served by Gast\u00e3o Mesquita Airport.\nThe municipality contains part of the 8,716 hectares (21,540 acres) Perobas Biological Reserve, a strictly protected conservation unit created in 2006.[1]\n\nClothes\nToday Cianorte is the largest producer of clothing in southern Brazil. There are 300 clothing manufacturers in the industrial and commercial districts which employ 8,000 people. The production concentrates on informal clothing such as jeans and athletic wear, men's and women's fashion, infants' and toddlers' clothing.\nThroughout the year consumers and distributors come to Cianorte seeking clothing products, but every year the city hosts Expovest, the largest clothing fair in southern Brazil, in the city's central park. In that period the city receives about 5.500 tourists a month.\n\nEducation\nHas elementary schools, high schools, and two Universities.\n\nCulture\nThe cultural expressions of Cianorte are very diverse, including plays, movies, painting, plastic arts, music, etc.   \nAn old train station was transformed into the House of Culture (Casa da Cultura), with painting exhibitions, plastic arts, old pictures of the city, musical presentations, etc.\n\nExternal links\nCoordinates: 23\u00b037\u2032S 52\u00b037\u2032W\ufeff / \ufeff23.617\u00b0S 52.617\u00b0W\ufeff / -23.617; -52.617\n"}
