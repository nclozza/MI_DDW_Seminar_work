The Lepchas were the early settlers about five or six hundred years ago. Middle of 16th century the Bhutias, migrated from Tibet settled in the villages presently known as Kyongsa, Aritar, Tarpin, Reshi and Chalisey. The people who settled were Gorkha ethnic groups such as Newars, Bahuns (Adhikari, Poudyal, Gautam, Dahal, Bhandari, Pokhrel and Achaarja), Chhetri (Subedi, Khatiwada & Bista), Gurung, Rai and Limboo. Some people from Northern parts of India also migrated here at around 1940-1960 for business.\n\nPeople\nRhenock is inhabited by people of different ethnic groups such as Lepchas, Bhutias, Nepalis (Gorkhas), Biharis and Marwaris. Lepcha tribes who were early settlers have their own unique culture. Originally followers of Shamanism, they later became followers of Buddhism. Some of them are followers of Christianity. Bhutias are another group of tribes who are followers of Buddhism and who have their own identity and culture. The majority of the people are Indian Nepalis also known as Gorkha. Most of them are Hindus by religion. Some of the Nepalis Gurung after 1990 became Buddhist; before that they were followers of Hinduism. Some others are followers of Christianity. In spite of the above, everyone respects others' beliefs and faiths and celebrates others' festivals which makes a peaceful and prosperous society.\n\nEducational institutions\nRhenock has about 130 years of history of education. Rhenock School is among the oldest schools of Sikkim. It was established by a Christian missionary in 1880 at Rhenock (Khamdong).[3] Later it was taken over by the government of Sikkim and shifted to Kingstone. Presently the school is known as Senior Secondary School, Rhenock. A Sanskrit Pathshala (School) was run in the premises of Rhenock Temple to teach Sanskrit and rituals to train Hindu priests. After the merger of Sikkim into the Indian union more than a dozen schools were opened by the government of Sikkim.
