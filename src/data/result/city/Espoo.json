It is part of the Finnish Capital Region, along with the cities of Helsinki, Vantaa, and Kauniainen, and most of its population lives in the inner urban core of the Helsinki metropolitan area. Espoo shares its eastern border with Helsinki and Vantaa, while enclosing Kauniainen. Other bordering municipalities of Espoo are Nurmij\u00e4rvi and Vihti in the north, and Kirkkonummi in the west. The city is located on the shore of the Gulf of Finland, in the region of Uusimaa, and has a population of 284,444.[2]\nEspoo encompasses 528 square kilometres (204\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), of which 312\u00a0km2 (120\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) is land.[1] The national park of Nuuksio is situated in northwestern Espoo.\nEspoo does not have a traditional city center, having instead several local regional centers. Espoo is thus divided into seven major areas (Finnish: suuralueet, Swedish: storomr\u00e5den): Vanha-Espoo (with administrative center), Suur-Espoonlahti, Pohjois-Espoo, Suur-Kauklahti, Suur-Lepp\u00e4vaara, Suur-Matinkyl\u00e4, and Suur-Tapiola.\nAalto University is based in Otaniemi, Espoo, along with a thriving science community that includes numerous startups and organizations such as VTT \u2013 the Technical Research Center of Finland. Several major companies are based in Espoo, including Nokia, HMD Global, Tieto, KONE, Neste, Fortum, Orion Corporation, Outokumpu, and Foreca, as well as video game developers Rovio and Remedy Entertainment.\nThe city of Espoo is officially bilingual. The majority of the population, 83.6%, speaks Finnish as their mother tongue, while a minority of 8.3% speaks Swedish. 8% of Espoo's population has a first language other than Finnish or Swedish.\n\nEtymology\nThe name Espoo probably comes from the Swedish name for the River Espoo, Esp\u00e5 (or Esp\u00e5\u00e5), which in turn comes from the old Swedish word \u00e4spe, meaning a border of aspen, and the Swedish word for \"river\", \u00e5, thus \"a river bordered by aspen\". The name was first mentioned in 1431. The banks of the River Espoo are even today heavily populated with aspen.\n\nHistory\nThe first inhabitants in the area arrived about 9,000 years ago. Physical evidence (pollen grains) indicates agriculture from ca. 1000 AD, but there are no historical records. Up to the 13th century, the area was a borderland between the hunting grounds of Finnish Proper and Tavastian Finns, with a sparse population. Immigrants from Sweden established permanent agricultural settlements to the area from the late 13th century onwards after the so-called Second Crusade to Finland. Espoo was a subdivision of the Kirkkonummi congregation until 1486\u20131487. The oldest known document referring to Kirkkonummi is from 1330; Espoo as a subchapter has been dated to the 1380s, although the first document directly referring to Espoo is from as late as 1431. The construction of the Espoo Cathedral, the oldest preserved building in Espoo, marks the independence of Espoo. Administratively, Espoo was a part of Uusimaa. When the province was split to Eastern and Western provinces governed from the Porvoo and Raasepori castles, respectively, the eastern border of the Raasepori province was in Espoo. The 13th-century road connecting the most important cities in Finland at that time, the King's Road, passes through Espoo on its way from Stockholm via Turku and Porvoo to Viipuri.\nIn 1557, King Gustav Vasa decided to stabilize and develop the region by founding a royal mansion in Espoo. The government bought the villages of Esp\u00e5by and Mankby (Finnish: Mankki) and transferred the population elsewhere, and built the royal mansion in Esp\u00e5by. (Mankby was eventually abandoned and was never repopulated.) The royal mansion housed the king's local plenipotentiary (vogt), and collected royal tax in kind paid by labor on the mansion's farm. The administrative center Espoon keskus has grown around the church and the Espoo railway station, but the municipality has retained a network-like structure to the modern day.\nIn 1920, Espoo was only a rural municipality of about 9,000 inhabitants, of whom 70% were Swedish speaking. Agriculture was the primary source of income, with 75% of the population making their living from farming. Kauniainen was separated from Espoo in 1920, and it gained city rights the same year as Espoo, in 1972.\nEspoo started to grow rapidly in the 1940s and '50s. It quickly developed from a rural municipality into a fully-fledged industrial city, gaining city rights in 1972. Due to its proximity to Helsinki, Espoo soon became popular amongst people working in the capital. In the fifty years from 1950 to 2000, the population of Espoo grew from 22,000 to 210,000. Since 1945, the majority of people in Espoo have been Finnish-speaking. In 2006, the Swedish-speaking inhabitants represented barely 9% of the total population. The population growth is still continuing, but at a slower rate.\n\nLocation\nEspoo is located in southern Finland, along the shore of the Gulf of Finland, and in the region of Uusimaa and the Helsinki sub-region. Prior to the abolition of Finnish provinces in 2009, Espoo was a part of the Southern Finland Province.\nThe city borders Helsinki, the Finnish capital, which is to the east. Other neighbouring municipalities are Vantaa to the east and northeast, Nurmij\u00e4rvi to the north, Vihti to the northwest, and Kirkkonummi to the west and southwest. Espoo is a part of the Finnish Capital Region, which is the inner core of the Greater Helsinki metropolitan area.\n\nSubdivision\nEspoo is divided into seven major areas (Finnish: suuralueet, Swedish: storomr\u00e5den): Vanha-Espoo (with administrative center), Suur-Espoonlahti, Pohjois-Espoo, Suur-Kauklahti, Suur-Lepp\u00e4vaara, Suur-Matinkyl\u00e4, and Suur-Tapiola. These major areas are then divided into a total of 56 districts.\n\nFeatures\nAlthough Espoo is relatively highly populated, it has large amounts of natural wilderness, particularly in the city's western and northern portions. The city has a total of 71 lakes, the largest of which are Lake Bodom, Nuuksion Pitk\u00e4j\u00e4rvi, Vanhankyl\u00e4n Pitk\u00e4j\u00e4rvi, Looj\u00e4rvi, Velskolan Pitk\u00e4j\u00e4rvi, Saarij\u00e4rvi, Matalaj\u00e4rvi, Siikaj\u00e4rvi, and Lippaj\u00e4rvi. The city has a large coastline on the Gulf of Finland.\nEspoo has six Natura 2000 protected areas: B\u00e5nberget forests, Espoonlahti\u2013Saunalahti bay area (partially in Kirkkonummi), Laajalahti bay, Matalaj\u00e4rvi lake, Nuuksio National Park (partially in Kirkkonummi and Vihti), as well as forests in Vestra (partially in Vantaa).\nThe official animal of Espoo is the Siberian flying squirrel, the official bird is the common blackbird, and the official plant is Anemone nemorosa.\n\nDemographics\nThe population by citizenship in 2018 was 89.1% Finnish and 10.9% other nationalities. Religious affiliation was 53.6% Lutheran, 4.3% other, and 42.1% no religious affiliation.\nEspoo contains many high income suburbs, and six out of the ten highest average income postal code areas in Finland are in Espoo.[citation needed]\n\nImmigrants and language\nIn 2018, there were 48,346 residents with a foreign background, 17% of the population. The largest groups are from Estonia, Russia and Iraq.\n\nCulture\nEspoo hosts a Museum of Modern Art called EMMA (Espoo Museum of Modern Art), built in a renovated old print house, the WeeGee house, named after an old book print company Weilin & G\u00f6\u00f6s. The same building hosts also Finland's only Museum of Horology (Finnish: Kellomuseo, Swedish: Urmuseum) and a Toy Museum. Glims Farmstead Museum is also located in the city. The Espoo cultural centre, home of the world-renowned Tapiola Sinfonietta, where numerous concerts and theater performances are held, is located in Tapiola (Swedish: Hagalund).\nEspoo has several old manors of which two are open to the general public. The most important is Espoon kartano (Swedish: Esbo g\u00e5rd, Espoo Manor), first mentioned in maps in 1495, and belonging to the noble Ramsay family since 1756. The current main building dates back to 1914, but a mill dates from the 1750s and Finland oldest walved stone bridge from 1777 is on the King's Road (Finnish: Kuninkaantie, Swedish: Kungsv\u00e4gen) which passes by the manor. The main building can be rented for weddings and similar occasions. Guided tours are available on request for groups. The other manor open to public is Pakankyl\u00e4n kartano, located on the northern shore of Lake Bodom. The manor hosts a restaurant and club rooms, partly with original furniture open to the public, but meant originally to Kaisankoti sanatory and old people's home located on ground of the manor.\nThe Metal band Children of Bodom comes from Espoo, Finland. They are named after the unsolved murder known as the Lake Bodom murders which took place at the shore of Lake Bodom, a lake in northern Espoo, in 1960. The bands Norther and Kiuas also come from Espoo.\nThe educational department took part in Lifelong Learning Programme 2007\u20132013 in Finland.\n\nSports\nAt the 1952 Summer Olympics, the city's Westend Tennis Hall hosted the fencing events.\n\nIce hockey\nEspoo Blues was a successful hockey club; between 1998 and 2016 it iced a men's hockey team which played at the men's premier SM-liiga and a women's hockey team which played at the women's premier Naisten SM-sarja.
