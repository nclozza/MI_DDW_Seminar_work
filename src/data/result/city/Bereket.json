Bereket is the administrative centre of the Bereket District.\nThe city is located in an oasis in the foothills of the Kopetdag Mountains and on the edge of the Karakum Desert.\nBereket is an important strategic railway intersection of the Trans-Caspian Railway (Caspian Sea-Turkmenistan-Uzbekistan-Kazakhstan) and North-South Transnational Railway (Russia-Kazakhstan-Turkmenistan-Iran-Persian Gulf.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.railway-technology.com/projects/northsouthtransnatio/\", \"title\": \"North-South Transnational Corridor\", \"publisher\": \"railway-technology.com\"}{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.turkmenistaninfo.ru/?page_id=6&type=article&elem_id=page_6/magazine_114/1011&lang_id=en\", \"title\": \"Crossing of Railways\", \"publisher\": \"turkmenistaninfo.ru\"}\nThe city has a large locomotive repair depot and a modern railway station.\nThe city is located approximately 260\u00a0km (162\u00a0mi) west of the Turkmen capital of Ashgabat and 340\u00a0km (211\u00a0mi) east of the Caspian Sea port of Turkmenbashi.

Gazanjyk is probably derived from a Turkic language word  gazan or kazan (meaning a large cooking pot used throughout Central Asia, roughly equivalent to a cauldron, boiler) and -jyk a suffix to denote small in size. The name can be translated into English as small kazan or small cauldron. \nThe present-day name of the city Bereket in the Turkmen language means abundance or prosperity. The word Bereket is borrowed from the Persian word Barakat (\u0628\u0631\u06a9\u062a) into Turkmen. Persian in turn has borrowed it from Arabic Barakah (\u0628\u0631\u06a9\u0629).\n\nHistory\nSince ancient times the area where city is now located was known as an important junction on the famous Silk Road that connected China with the Middle East and Europe.\nAleksey Kuropatkin, the Imperial Russian Army commander of the Turkestan Rifle Brigade, who made an 18-day march in 1880\u20131881 across 800 kilometres (500\u00a0mi) of Karakum desert writes in his memoirs \"the 5th transition to Kazandjik \u2013 64 miles [103\u00a0km].
