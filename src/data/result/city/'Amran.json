At the time of the Sabaean kingdom, the town blossomed into a fortress.  A series of bronze plaques from that time were found in the town in the mid-nineteenth century and are now in the British Museum.  In particular, in the seventh century it was the great city of valour during the clashes against the Sabeans, a plurality of regionally based tribes.  Remains of carved stones that belonged to former temples and palaces bear witness today of past glory.  A large stone inscription is found in the western city gate (Bab al-Kabir).  The old souq is noted for its stone columns.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"date\": \"1 August 1999\", \"title\": \"Yemen\", \"url\": \"https://books.google.com/books?id=RCYuAQAAIAAJ\", \"publisher\": \"Lonely Planet\", \"isbn\": \"978-0-86442-603-1\", \"accessdate\": \"13 April 2012\", \"last\": \"H\\u00e4m\\u00e4l\\u00e4inen\", \"first\": \"Pertti\"}  \u02bfAmram is completely surrounded by walls which date to 1720.  The surrounding landscape is dominated by terraced landscapes with stone walls to counteract erosion of fertile arable land.\n\nEconomic development\nThe road through the city from Sana'a was modernized following Chinese investment and is over 200\u00a0km (120\u00a0mi) long, and the old medical centre has been transformed into a small public hospital.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"date\": \"12 February 2008\", \"title\": \"Yemen: The Bradt Travel Guide\", \"url\": \"https://books.google.com/books?id=eQvhZaEVzjcC&pg=PA107\", \"publisher\": \"Bradt Travel Guides\", \"page\": \"107\", \"isbn\": \"978-1-84162-212-5\", \"accessdate\": \"13 April 2012\", \"last\": \"McLaughlin\", \"first\": \"Daniel\"} The city is located in a fertile area in what was the centre of the area's coffee industry.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"last1\": \"McCulloch\", \"first1\": \"John Ramsay\", \"last2\": \"Haskel\", \"first2\": \"Daniel\", \"year\": \"1845\", \"title\": \"M'Culloch's Universal gazetteer: Dictionary, geographical, statistical, and historical, of the various countries, places, and principal natural objects in the world\", \"url\": \"https://books.google.com/books?id=DfoRAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA93\", \"edition\": \"Public domain\", \"publisher\": \"Harper & brothers\", \"pages\": \"93\\u2013\", \"accessdate\": \"15 April 2012\"}\n\nReferences\nCoordinates: 15\u00b040\u2032N 43\u00b057\u2032E\ufeff / \ufeff15.667\u00b0N 43.950\u00b0E\ufeff / 15.667; 43.950\n\n",
