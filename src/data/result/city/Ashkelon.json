The ancient seaport of Ashkelon dates back to the Neolithic Age. In the course of its history, it has been ruled by the Ancient Egyptians, the Canaanites, the Philistines, the Assyrians, the Babylonians, the Greeks, the Phoenicians, the Hasmoneans, the Romans, the Persians, the Arabs and the Crusaders, until it was destroyed by the Mamluks in 1270.\nThe Arab village of al-Majdal or al-Majdal Asqalan (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062c\u062f\u0644\u200e; Hebrew: \u05d0\u05b5\u05dc\u05be\u05de\u05b4\u05d2\u05b0\u05f3\u05d3\u05b7\u05bc\u05dc) was established a few kilometres inland from the ancient site by the late 15th century, under Ottoman rule. In 1918, it became part of the British Occupied Enemy Territory Administration and in 1920 became part of Mandatory Palestine. Al-Majdal on the eve of the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War had 10,000 Arab inhabitants and in October 1948, the city accommodated thousands more refugees from nearby villages.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"last1\": \"Masalha\", \"first1\": \"Nur\", \"authorlink1\": \"Nur Masalha\", \"date\": \"2012\", \"title\": \"The Palestine Nakba: Decolonising History, Narrating the Subaltern, Reclaiming Memory\", \"location\": \"London\", \"publisher\": \"Zed Books, Limited\", \"isbn\": \"1848139705\"} Al-Majdal was the forward position of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force based in Gaza.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"date\": \"2008-10-01\", \"title\": \"1948: A History of the First Arab-Israeli War\", \"url\": \"https://books.google.com/books?id=CC7381HrLqcC&pg=PA331&lpg=PA331&dq=majdal+egyptian+expeditionary+northernmost&source=bl&ots=wlmgnJG9Ua&sig=P1JDvozg_m-LHvD-A2Rx6kZzdWk&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiP55HtqsrPAhVE6WMKHQD_BjAQ6AEIOzAE#v=onepage&q=majdal%20egyptian%20expeditionary%20northernmost&f=false\", \"language\": \"en\", \"publisher\": \"Yale University Press\", \"pages\": \"331\", \"isbn\": \"0300145241\", \"last\": \"Morris\", \"first\": \"Benny\"} The village was conquered by Israeli forces on 5 November 1948, by which time most of the Arab population had fled,[4] leaving some 2,700 inhabitants, of which 500 were deported by Israeli soldiers in December 1948.[4] The town was initially named Migdal Gaza, Migdal Gad and Migdal Ashkelon by the new Jewish inhabitants. Most of the remaining Arabs were deported by 1950.[citation needed]\nIn 1953, the nearby neighborhood of Afridar was incorporated and the name \"Ashkelon\" was readopted to the town.

It is dated by Radiocarbon dating to c.\u00a07900 bp (uncalibrated), to the poorly known Pre-Pottery Neolithic C phase of the Neolithic. It was discovered and excavated in 1954 by French archaeologist Jean Perrot. In 1997\u20131998, a large scale salvage project was conducted at the site by Yosef Garfinkel on behalf of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and nearly 1,000 square metres (11,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft) were examined. A final excavation report was published in 2008.\nIn the site over a hundred fireplaces and hearths were found and numerous pits, but no solid architecture, except for one wall. Various phases of occupation were found, one atop the other, with sterile layers of sea sand between them. This indicates that the site was occupied on a seasonal basis.\nThe main finds were enormous quantities of c.\u00a0100,000 animal bones and c.\u00a020,000 flint artifacts. Usually at Neolithic sites flints far outnumber animal bones. The bones belong to domesticated and non-domesticated animals. When all aspects of this site are taken into account, it appears to have been used by pastoral nomads for meat processing. The nearby sea could supply salt necessary for the conservation of meat.\n\nCanaanite settlement\nThe city was originally built on a sandstone outcropping and has a good underground water supply. It was relatively large as an ancient city with as many as 15,000 people living inside the walls. Ashkelon was a thriving Middle Bronze Age (2000\u20131550 BCE) city of more than 150 acres (61\u00a0ha). Its commanding ramparts, measuring 1.5 miles (2.4\u00a0km) long, 50 feet (15\u00a0m) high and 150 feet (46\u00a0m) thick,[citation needed], and even as a ruin they stand two stories high. The thickness of the walls was so great that the mudbrick city gate had a stone-lined, 8 feet (2.4\u00a0m) wide tunnel-like barrel vault, coated with white plaster, to support the superstructure: it is the oldest such vault ever found.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"April 8, 2008\", \"title\": \"Oldest arched gate in the world restored\", \"url\": \"http://www.jpost.com/Local-Israel/Around-Israel/Oldest-arched-gate-in-the-world-restored\", \"location\": \"[[Jerusalem]]\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20130814034938/http://www.jpost.com/Local-Israel/Around-Israel/Oldest-arched-gate-in-the-world-restored\", \"archivedate\": \"August 14, 2013\", \"accessdate\": \"January 21, 2018\", \"first\": \"Etgar\", \"last\": \"Lefkovits\"} Later Roman and Islamic fortifications, faced with stone, followed the same footprint, a vast semicircle protecting Ashkelon on the land side. On the sea it was defended by a high natural bluff. A roadway more than 20 feet (6.1\u00a0m) in width ascended the rampart from the harbor and entered a gate at the top.\nIn 1991 the ruins of a small ceramic tabernacle was found a finely cast bronze statuette of a bull calf, originally silvered, 4 inches (10\u00a0cm) long. Images of calves and bulls were associated with the worship of the Canaanite gods El and Baal.\nAshkelon is mentioned in the Egyptian Execration Texts of the 11th dynasty as \"Asqanu.\"{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0002_0_01460.html\", \"title\": \"Ashkelon, Jewish Virtual Library\", \"publisher\": \"Jewishvirtuallibrary.org\", \"accessdate\": \"2011-08-10\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20110717053009/https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0002_0_01460.html\", \"archivedate\": \"17 July 2011\"} In the Amarna letters (c. 1350 BC), there are seven letters to and from Ashkelon's (A\u0161qaluna) king Yidya, and the Egyptian pharaoh. One letter from the pharaoh to Yidya was discovered in the early 1900s.\n\nPhilistine settlement\nThe Philistines conquered Canaanite Ashkelon about 1150 BCE. Their earliest pottery, types of structures and inscriptions are similar to the early Greek urbanised centre at Mycenae in mainland Greece, adding weight to the hypothesis that the Philistines were one of the populations among the \"Sea Peoples\" that upset cultures throughout the eastern Mediterranean at that time.\nAshkelon became one of the five Philistine cities that were constantly warring with the Israelites and later the United Kingdom of Israel and successive Kingdom of Judah. According to Herodotus, its temple of Venus was the oldest of its kind, imitated even in Cyprus, and he mentions that this temple was pillaged by marauding Scythians during the time of their sway over the Medes (653\u2013625 BC). As it was the last of the Philistine cities to hold out against Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar II. When it fell in 604 BC, burnt and destroyed and its people taken into exile, the Philistine era was over.[citation needed]\n\nClassical period\nAshkelon was soon rebuilt. Until the conquest of Alexander the Great, Ashkelon's inhabitants were influenced by the dominant Persian culture. It is in this archaeological layer that excavations have found dog burials. It is believed the dogs may have had a sacred role, however evidence is not conclusive. After the conquest of Alexander in the 4th century BC, Ashkelon was an important free city and Hellenistic seaport.\nIt had mostly friendly relations with the Hasmonean kingdom and Herodian kingdom of Judea, in the 2nd and 1st centuries BCE. In a significant case of an early witch-hunt, during the reign of the Hasmonean queen Salome Alexandra, the court of Simeon ben Shetach sentenced to death eighty women in Ashkelon who had been charged with sorcery.[11] Herod the Great, who became a client king of Rome over Judea and its surrounds in 30 BCE, had not received Ashkelon, yet he built monumental buildings there: bath houses, elaborate fountains and large colonnades.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://pace-ancient.mcmaster.ca/york/york/placePopup?id=24&descOnly=\", \"title\": \"Ashkelon\", \"publisher\": \"Project on Ancient Cultural Engagement/Brill\", \"accessdate\": \"14 July 2014\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20150904060244/http://pace-ancient.mcmaster.ca/york/york/placePopup?id=24&descOnly=\", \"archivedate\": \"4 September 2015\"}[13] A discredited tradition suggests Ashkelon has been his birthplace.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"chapterurl \": \"http://www.sacred-texts.com/chr/ecf/201/2010033.htm\", \"title \": \"The Church History of Eusebius\", \"chapter \": \"VI\", \"at \": \"\\u00a72, notes 90-91\", \"author \": \"Eusebius\", \"authorlink \": \"Eusebius\", \"editorfirst \": \"Arthur Cushman\", \"editorlast \": \"McGiffert\", \"editorlink \": \"Arthur Cushman McGiffert\", \"series \": \"Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers, series II\"} In 6 CE, when a Roman imperial province was set in Judea, overseen by a lower-rank governor, Ashkelon was moved directly to the higher jurisdiction of the governor of Syria province.\nThe city remained loyal to Rome during the Great Revolt, 66\u201370 AD.\n\nByzantine period\nThe city of Ascalon appears on a fragment of the 6th century AD Madaba Map.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"1992\", \"title\": \"The Mosaic Map of Madaba\", \"url\": \"https://books.google.com/books?id=XbGEngEACAAJ&dq=Donner+%28The+Mosaic+Map+of+Madaba&hl=en&sa=X&ei=gB-DVILLNsbyUtj_gbgN&redir_esc=y\", \"publisher\": \"Kok Pharos Publishing House\", \"isbn\": \"978-90-3900011-3\", \"first\": \"Herbert\", \"last\": \"Donner\"}\nThe bishops of Ascalon whose names are known include Sabinus, who was at the First Council of Nicaea in 325, and his immediate successor, Epiphanius. Auxentius took part in the First Council of Constantinople in 381, Jobinus in a synod held in Lydda in 415, Leontius in both the Robber Council of Ephesus in 449 and the Council of Chalcedon in 451. Bishop Dionysius, who represented Ascalon at a synod in Jerusalem in 536, was on another occasion called upon to pronounce on the validity of a baptism with sand in waterless desert and sent the person to be baptized in water.[16][17]\nNo longer a residential bishopric, Ascalon is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.[18]\n\nEarly Islamic period\nDuring the Muslim conquest of Palestine begun in c.\u2009633\u2013634, Ascalon (called Asqalan by the Arabs) became one of the last Byzantine cities to fall in the region.{\"citetype\": \"journal\", \"last \": \"Hartmann\",

Muhammad, which was buried in the city.[21] The mausoleum was described as the most magnificent building in Ashkelon.[22] In the British Mandate period it was a \"large maqam on top of a hill\" with no tomb, but a fragment of a pillar showing the place where the head had been buried.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"1927\", \"title\": \"Mohammedan Saints and Sanctuaries in Palestine\",

the shrine was destroyed at the instructions of Moshe Dayan in accordance with a 1950s Israeli policy of erasing Muslim historical sites within Israel.[24]\nDuring the Crusades, Asqalan (known to the Crusaders as Ascalon) was an important city due to its location near the coast and between the Crusader States and Egypt. In 1099, shortly after the siege of Jerusalem, a Fatimid army that had been sent to relieve Jerusalem was defeated by a Crusader force at the Battle of Ascalon. The city itself was not captured by the Crusaders because of internal disputes among their leaders. This battle is widely considered to have signified the end of the First Crusade.[citation needed] As a result of military reinforcements from Egypt and a large influx of refugees from areas conquered by the Crusaders, Asqalan became a major Fatimid frontier post.[21] The Fatimids utilized it to launch raids into the Kingdom of Jerusalem.[25] Trade ultimately resumed between Asqalan and Crusader-controlled Jerusalem, though the inhabitants of Asqalan regularly struggled with shortages in food and supplies, necessitating the provision of goods and relief troops to the city from Egypt on several occasions each year.[21] According to William of Tyre, the entire civilian population of the city was included in the Fatimid army registers.[21] The Crusaders' capture of the port city of Tyre in 1134 and their construction of a ring of fortresses around the city to neutralize its threat to Jerusalem strategically weakened Asqalan.[21] In 1150 the Fatimids fortified the city with fifty-three towers, as it was their most important frontier fortress.[26] Three years later, after a seven-month siege, the city was captured by a Crusader army led by King Baldwin III of Jerusalem.[21] The Fatimids secured the head of Husayn from its mausoleum in the city and transported it to their capital Cairo.[21] Ascalon was then added to the County of Jaffa to form the County of Jaffa and Ascalon, which became one of the four major seigneuries of the Kingdom of Jerusalem.\nAfter the Crusader conquest of Jerusalem the six elders of the Karaite Jewish community in Ashkelon contributed to the ransoming of captured Jews and holy relics from Jerusalem's new rulers. The Letter of the Karaite elders of Ascalon, which was sent to the Jewish elders of Alexandria, describes their participation in the ransom effort and the ordeals suffered by many of the freed captives. A few hundred Jews, Karaites and Rabbanites, were living in Ashkelon in the second half of the 12th century, but moved to Jerusalem when the city was destroyed in 1191.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"author \": \"Alex Carmel, Peter Sch\\u00e4fer and Yossi Ben-Artzi\", \"title \": \"The Jewish Settlement in Palestine, 634\\u20131881\", \"series \": \"Beihefte zum T\\u00fcbinger Atlas des Vorderen Orients : Reihe B, Geisteswissenschaften; Nr. 88\", \"location \": \"Wiesbaden\", \"publisher \": \"Reichert\", \"year \": \"1990\"}\nIn 1187, Saladin took Ashkelon as part of his conquest of the Crusader States following the Battle of Hattin. In 1191, during the Third Crusade, Saladin demolished the city because of its potential strategic importance to the Christians, but the leader of the Crusade, King Richard I of England, constructed a citadel upon the ruins. Ashkelon subsequently remained part of the diminished territories of Outremer throughout most of the 13th century and Richard, Earl of Cornwall reconstructed and refortified the citadel during 1240\u201341, as part of the Crusader policy of improving the defences of coastal sites. The Egyptians retook Ashkelon in 1247 during As-Salih Ayyub's conflict with the Crusader States and the city was returned to Muslim rule. The Mamluk dynasty came into power in Egypt in 1250 and the ancient and medieval history of Ashkelon was brought to an end in 1270, when the Mamluk sultan Baybars ordered the citadel and harbour at the site to be destroyed. As a result of this destruction, the site was abandoned by its inhabitants and fell into disuse.\n\nOttoman era\nThe Arab village of Majdal was mentioned by historians and tourists at the end of the 15th century.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"author \": \"Orna Cohen\", \"title \": \"&quot;Transferred to Gaza of Their Own Accord&quot; The Arabs of Majdal in Ashkelon and their Evacuation to the Gaza Strip in 1950\", \"publisher \": \"The Harry S.
