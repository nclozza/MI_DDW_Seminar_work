It is a renowned historic city, containing numerous historic mansions and streets as well as over 140 protected historical sites that range from the Tang to the Qing dynasties. As of 2005, it has a population of around 385,000 people.\n\nHistory\nIn ancient times, Yu the Great bored a tunnel in the nearby Mount Longmen (Dragon Gate Mountain) to alleviate the frequent flooding that occurred in the area, which led to the area being called Dragon Gate (\u9f8d\u9580). During the Western Zhou Dynasty, the area was bestowed on the Han Marquises. During the Spring and Autumn period, the area was under the administration of the State of Jin and became known as Hanyuan (\u97d3\u539f) or \"Land of the Hans.\" In the Warring States period, the area belonged to the State of Wei and was called Shaoliang (\u5c11\u6881). Towards the end of the Warring States Period, the State of Qin conquered and designated the area as Xiayang County (\u590f\u9633\u53bf). In the Sui Dynasty, the area received its present name of Hancheng.\nIn 1983, Hancheng County became Hancheng City. In 1986, the city was named a National Historic and Cultural City (\u56fd\u5bb6\u5386\u53f2\u6587\u5316\u540d\u57ce) and, in 2007, was added to the list of Prime Tourist Cities of China (\u4e2d\u56fd\u4f18\u79c0\u65c5\u6e38\u57ce\u5e02).[citation needed]\n\nEconomy\nHancheng has the biggest power plant in western China, generating over 2,400,000\u00a0kW.\n\nCulture\nThe famed Chinese historian Sima Qian was born in Hancheng in the Han Dynasty and buried nearby.\n\nExternal links\n\n",
