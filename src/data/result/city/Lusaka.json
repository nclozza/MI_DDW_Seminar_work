Lusaka is in the southern part of the central plateau at an elevation of about 1,279 metres (4,196\u00a0ft). As of 2010[update], the city's population was about 1.7 million, while the urban population is estimated at 2.5 million in 2018.[5] Lusaka is the centre of both commerce and government in Zambia and connects to the country's four main highways heading north, south, east and west. English is the official language of the city administration, while Nyanja and Bemba are the commonly spoken street languages.\n\nHistory\nLusaka was the site of a village named after its Chief Lusaka, which, according to history, was located at Manda Hill, near where the Zambia's National Assembly building now stands. In the Nyanja language, Manda means \"graveyard.\" The area was expanded by European (mainly British) settlers in 1905 with the building of the railway.

Its central nature and fast growing infrastructure sector have increased donor confidence and as such Zambians are seeing signs of development in the form of job creation, housing, etc. Consequently, it is thought that with proper and effective economic reforms, Lusaka as well as Zambia as a whole will develop considerably. Lusaka is home to a diverse community of foreign nationals, many of whom work in the aid industry as well as diplomats, representatives of religious organisations and some business people.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"date\": \"2010\", \"title\": \"Zambia: Life in an African Country\", \"url\": \"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DFVS4IixY5oC&pg=PA159\", \"urlstatus\": \"live\", \"language\": \"en\", \"publisher\": \"New Africa Press\", \"pages\": \"159\", \"isbn\": \"9789987160112\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20180502234040/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DFVS4IixY5oC&pg=PA159\", \"archivedate\": \"2 May 2018\", \"last\": \"Mwakikagile\", \"first\": \"Godfrey\"}\n\nGovernment\nAs the national capital, Lusaka is the seat of the legislative, executive and judicial branches of government, epitomized by the presence of the National Assembly (parliament), the State House (office of the President), and the High Court.
