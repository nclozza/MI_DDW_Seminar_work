The Jewish settlers have their own governing municipal body, the Committee of the Jewish Community of Hebron.\nHebron is a busy hub of West Bank trade, generating roughly a third of the area's gross domestic product, largely due to the sale of limestone from quarries in its area.[23] It has a local reputation for its grapes, figs, limestone, pottery workshops and glassblowing factories, and has the major dairy-product manufacturer al-Juneidi. The old city of Hebron features narrow, winding streets, flat-roofed stone houses, and old bazaars. The city is home to Hebron University and Palestine Polytechnic University.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"title \": \"Hebron University\", \"last \": \"Hasasneh\", \"first \": \"Nabeel\", \"work \": \"Digi-arts.

Hebron Governorate is the largest Palestinian governorate, with a population of 600,364 as of 2010[update].[26]\n\nEtymology\nThe name \"Hebron\" traces back to two Semitic roots, which coalesce in the form \u1e25br, having reflexes in Hebrew and Amorite and denoting a range of meanings from \"colleague\", \"unite\" or \"friend\". In the proper name Hebron, the original sense may have been alliance.[27]\nThe Arabic term derives from the Qur'anic epithet for Abraham, Khalil al-Rahman (\u0625\u0628\u0631\u0627\u0647\u064a\u0645 \u062e\u0644\u064a\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062d\u0645\u0646) \"Beloved of the Merciful\" or \"Friend of God\".{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.geocities.com/hollywood/lot/6093/4nisa.html\", \"title\": \"source text\", \"accessdate\": \"2007-07-30\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20091027154527/http://www.geocities.com/hollywood/lot/6093/4nisa.html\"}[29] Arabic Al-Khalil thus precisely translates the ancient Hebrew toponym \u1e24ebron, understood as \u1e25aber (friend).[30]\n\nCanaanite period\nArchaeological excavations reveal traces of strong fortifications dated to the Early Bronze Age, covering some 24\u201330 dunams centered around Tel Rumeida. The city flourished in the 17th\u201318th centuries BCE before being destroyed by fire, and was resettled in the late Middle Bronze Age.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"title \": \"Archaeological Encyclopedia of the Holy Land\", \"editor1last \": \"Negev\", \"editor1first \": \"Avraham\", \"editor2last \": \"Gibson\", \"editor2first \": \"S.\", \"editor2link \": \"Shimon Gibson\", \"publisher \": \"Continuum International Publishing Group\", \"year \": \"2001\", \"isbn \": \"978-0-14-311489-5\", \"url \": \"https://books.google.com/books?id=27nq65cZUIgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=\", \"accessdate \": \"26 July 2011\"}[32] This older Hebron was originally a Canaanite royal city.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"title \": \"Genesis\", \"last \": \"Towner\", \"first \": \"Wayne Sibley\", \"publisher \": \"Westminster John Knox Press\", \"year \": \"2001\", \"isbn \": \"978-0-664-25256-4\", \"url \": \"https://books.google.com/books?id=6ONdsoa7MHUC&pg=PA144\", \"accessdate \": \"26 July 2011\"} Abrahamic legend associates the city with the Hittites. It has been conjectured that Hebron might have been the capital of Shuwardata of Gath, an Indo-European (Canaanite) contemporary of Jerusalem's regent, Abdi-Kheba,[34] although the Hebron hills were almost devoid of settlements in the Late Bronze Age.[35] The Abrahamic traditions associated with Hebron are nomadic.

They were ruled by the three sons of Anak (ben\u00ea/yel\u00eed\u00ea h\u0101'\u0103naq).[38] or may reflect some Kenite and Kenizzite migration from the Negev to Hebron, since terms related to the Kenizzites appear to be close to Hurrian.

In his writings he also mentioned camel caravans transporting firewood from Hebron to Jerusalem, which implies there was a presence of Arab nomads in the region at that time.[72] Trade greatly expanded, in particular with Bedouins in the Negev (al-Naqab) and the population to the east of the Dead Sea (Ba\u1e25r L\u016b\u1e6d). According to Anton Kisa, Jews from Hebron (and Tyre) founded the Venetian glass-industry in the 9th century.[73] Islam did not view the town significant before the 10th-century, it being almost absent in Muslim literature of the period.[74] Jerusalemite geographer al-Muqaddasi, writing in 985 described the town as follows:Habra (Hebron) is the village of Abraham al-Khalil (the Friend of God)...Within it is a strong fortress...being of enormous squared stones. In the middle of this stands a dome of stone, built in Islamic times, over the sepulchre of Abraham. The tomb of Isaac lies forward, in the main building of the mosque, the tomb of Jacob to the rear; facing each prophet lies his wife. The enclosure has been converted into a mosque, and built around it are rest houses for the pilgrims, so that they adjoin the main edifice on all sides. A small water conduit has been conducted to them. All the countryside around this town for about half a stage has villages in every direction, with vineyards and grounds producing grapes and apples called Jabal Nahra...being fruit of unsurpassed excellence...Much of this fruit is dried, and sent to Egypt.\nIn Hebron is a public guest house continuously open, with a cook, a baker and servants in regular attendance. These offer a dish of lentils and olive oil to every poor person who arrives, and it is set before the rich, too, should they wish to partake. Most men express the opinion this is a continuation of the guest house of Abraham, however, it is, in fact from the bequest of [the sahaba (companion) of the prophet Muhammad] Tamim-al Dari and others.... The Amir of Khurasan...has assigned to this charity one thousand dirhams yearly, ...al-Shar al-Adil bestowed on it a substantial bequest. At present time I do not know in all the realm of al-Islam any house of hospitality and charity more excellent than this one.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"title \": \"The Best Divisions for Knowledge of the Regions.

The Persian traveller Nasir-i-Khusraw who visited Hebron in 1047 records in his Safarnama that\n... this Sanctuary has belonging to it very many villages that provide revenues for pious purposes. At one of these villages is a spring, where water flows out from under a stone, but in no great abundance; and it is conducted by a channel, cut in the ground, to a place outside the town (of Hebron), where they have constructed a covered tank for collecting the water...The Sanctuary (Mashad), stands on the southern border of the town....it is enclosed by four walls. The Mihrab (or niche) and the Maksurah (or enclosed space for Friday-prayers) stand in the width of the building (at the south end). In the Maksurah are many fine Mihrabs.[76] He further recorded that \"They grow at Hebron for the most part barley, wheat being rare, but olives are in abundance. The [visitors] are given bread and olives. There are very many mills here, worked by oxen and mules, that all day long grind the flour, and further, there are working girls who, during the whole day are baking bread. The loaves are [about three pounds] and to every persons who arrives they give daily a loaf of bread, and a dish of lentils cooked in olive-oil, also some raisins....there are some days when as many as five hundred pilgrims arrive, to each of whom this hospitality is offered.\"[77][78]Geniza documents from this period refer only to \"the graves of the patriarchs\" and reveal there was an organised Jewish community in Hebron who had a synagogue near the tomb, and were occupied with accommodating Jewish pilgrims and merchants. During the Seljuk period, the community was headed by Saadia b. Abraham b. Nathan, who was known as the \"haver of the graves of the patriarchs.\"[79]\n\nCrusader rule\n\nThe Caliphate lasted in the area until 1099, when the Christian Crusader Godfrey de Bouillon took Hebron and renamed it \"Castellion Saint Abraham\".[80] It was designated capital of the southern district of the Crusader Kingdom[81] and given, in turn,[82] as the fief of Saint Abraham, to Geldemar Carpinel, the bishop Gerard of Avesnes,{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"title \": \"A History of the Crusades:The First Crusade and the Foundation of the Kingdom of Jerusalem\", \"last \": \"Runciman\", \"first \": \"S.\", \"authorlink \": \"Steven Runciman\", \"publisher \": \"Penguin Books\", \"year \": \"1965a\", \"origyear \": \"1951\", \"url \": \"https://books.google.com/books?id=0bEqAAAAYAAJ&q=\", \"accessdate \": \"26 July 2011\"} Hugh of Rebecques, Walter Mohamet and Baldwin of Saint Abraham.

In 1106, an Egyptian campaign thrust into southern Palestine and almost succeeded the following year in wresting Hebron back from the Crusaders under Baldwin I of Jerusalem, who personally led the counter-charge to beat the Muslim forces off. In the year 1113 during the reign of Baldwin II of Jerusalem, according to Ali of Herat (writing in 1173), a certain part over the cave of Abraham had given way, and \"a number of Franks had made their entrance therein\". And they discovered \"(the bodies) of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob\", \"their shrouds having fallen to pieces, lying propped up against a wall...Then the King, after providing new shrouds, caused the place to be closed once more\". Similar information is given in Ibn at Athir's Chronicle under the year 1119; \"In this year was opened the tomb of Abraham, and those of his two sons Isaac and Jacob ...Many people saw the Patriarch. Their limbs had nowise been disturbed, and beside them were placed lamps of gold and of silver.\"[85] The Damascene nobleman and historian Ibn al-Qalanisi in his chronicle also alludes at this time to the discovery of relics purported to be those of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, a discovery which excited eager curiosity among all three communities in Palestine, Muslim, Jewish, and Christian.{\"citetype\": \"journal\", \"title \": \"Un nouveau r\\u00e9cit de l'invention des Patriarches Abraham, Isaac et Jacob \\u00e0 Hebron\", \"last \": \"Kohler\", \"first \": \"C.\", \"journal \": \"[[Revue de l'Orient Latin]]\", \"location \": \"Paris\", \"volume \": \"4\", \"year \": \"1896\", \"page \": \"477\"}[87] Towards the end of the period of Crusader rule, in 1166 Maimonides visited Hebron and wrote,On Sunday, 9 Marheshvan (17 October), I left Jerusalem for Hebron to kiss the tombs of my ancestors in the Cave.

He reported:Here there is the great church called St. Abram, and this was a Jewish place of worship at the time of the Mohammedan rule, but the Gentiles have erected there six tombs, respectively called those of Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebekah, Jacob and Leah. The custodians tell the pilgrims that these are the tombs of the Patriarchs, for which information the pilgrims give them money. If a Jew comes, however, and gives a special reward, the custodian of the cave opens unto him a gate of iron, which was constructed by our forefathers, and then he is able to descend below by means of steps, holding a lighted candle in his hand. He then reaches a cave, in which nothing is to be found, and a cave beyond, which is likewise empty, but when he reaches the third cave behold there are six sepulchres, those of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, respectively facing those of Sarah, Rebekah and Leah.[91]\nAyyubid and Mamluk rule\nThe Kurdish Muslim Saladin retook Hebron in 1187 \u2013 again with Jewish assistance according to one late tradition, in exchange for a letter of security allowing them to return to the city and build a synagogue there.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"title \": \"A history of Palestine, 634\\u20131099\", \"last \": \"Gil\", \"first \": \"M.\", \"authorlink \": \"Moshe Gil\", \"publisher \": \"Cambridge University Press\", \"year \": \"1997\", \"editorlast \": \"Broido\", \"editorfirst\": \"Ethel\", \"isbn \": \"978-0-521-59984-9\", \"url \": \"https://books.google.com/books?id=M0wUKoMJeccC&printsec=frontcover&dq=\", \"accessdate \": \"25 July 2011\"} The name of the city was changed back to Al-Khalil.

Many Jews fled to Jerusalem, but during the general pillage of the town at least five were killed.[127] \nIn 1838, the total population was estimated at 10,000.[125] When the Government of Ibrahim Pasha fell in 1841, the local clan-head Abd ar-Rahman Amr once again resumed the reins of power as the Sheik of Hebron. Due to his extortionate demands for cash from the local population, most of the Jewish population fled to Jerusalem.[128] In 1846, the Ottoman Governor-in-chief of Jerusalem (serasker), K\u0131br\u0131sl\u0131 Mehmed Emin Pasha, waged a campaign to subdue rebellious sheiks in the Hebron area, and while doing so, allowed his troops to sack the town.

At the same time, Egypt began importing cheap European glass, the rerouting of the hajj from Damascus through Transjordan eliminated Hebron as a staging point, and the Suez canal (1869) dispensed with caravan trade. The consequence was a steady decline in the local economy.[134]\nAt this time, the town was divided into four quarters: the Ancient Quarter (Harat al-Kadim) near the Cave of Machpelah; to its south, the Quarter of the Silk Merchant (Harat al-Kazaz), inhabited by Jews; the Mameluke-era Sheikh's Quarter (Harat ash Sheikh) to the north-west;and further north, the Dense Quarter (Harat al-Harbah).[135]{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"title \": \"Triumph of survival: the story of the Jews in the modern era, 1650\\u20131990\", \"last \": \"Wilson\", \"first \": \"C.W.\", \"authorlink \": \"Charles William Wilson\", \"publisher \": \"D.

Kamil and his army marched towards Hebron in July 1855, with representatives from the English, French and other Western consulates as witnesses. After crushing all opposition, Kamil appointed Salama Amr, the brother and strong rival of Abd al Rachman, as nazir of the Hebron region. After this relative quiet reigned in the town for the next 4 years.[137][138] Hungarian Jews of the Karlin Hasidic court settled in another part of the city in 1866.[139] According to Nadav Shragai Arab-Jewish relations were good, and Alter Rivlin, who spoke Arabic and Syrian-Aramaic, was appointed Jewish representative to the city council.[139] Hebron suffered from a severe drought during 1869\u201371 and food sold for ten times the normal value.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"title \": \"The History of the Jews:From the Chmielnicki Persecution of the Jews in Poland (1648 CE) to the Period of Emancipation in Central Europe (c. 1870 CE)\", \"series \": \"History of the Jews\", \"last   \": \"Graetz\", \"first \": \"H.\", \"authorlink \": \"Heinrich Graetz\", \"editorlast \": \"L\\u00f6wy\", \"editorfirst \": \"Bella\", \"publisher \": \"Jewish Publication Society of America\", \"year \": \"1895\", \"volume \": \"5\", \"url \": \"https://books.google.com/books?id=_wgNAAAAIAAJ&q=\", \"accessdate \": \"27 July 2011\"} From 1874 the Hebron district as part of the Sanjak of Jerusalem was administered directly from Istanbul.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"title \": \"Palestinian Identity: The Construction of Modern National Consciousness\", \"last \": \"Khalidi\", \"first \": \"R.\", \"authorlink \": \"Rashid Khalidi\", \"publisher \": \"Columbia University Press\", \"year \": \"1998\", \"origyear \": \"1998\", \"isbn \": \"978-0-231-10515-6\", \"url \": \"https://books.google.com/books?id=pQx8u8MN13AC&pg=PA218\", \"accessdate \": \"28 July 2011\"}\nLate in the 19th century the production of Hebron glass declined due to competition from imported European glass-ware, however, the products of Hebron continued to be sold, particularly among the poorer populace and travelling Jewish traders from the city.[142] At the World Fair of 1873 in Vienna, Hebron was represented with glass ornaments. A report from the French consul in 1886 suggests that glass-making remained an important source of income for Hebron, with four factories earning 60,000 francs yearly.[143] While the economy of other cities in Palestine was based on solely on trade, Hebron was the only city in Palestine that combined agriculture, livestock herding and trade, including the manufacture of glassware and processing of hides.

The Jewish presence itself was divided between the traditional Sephardi community, Orthodox and anti-Zionist,[151] whose members spoke Arabic and adopted Arab dress, and the more recent influx of Ashkenazis. They prayed in different synagogues, sent their children to different schools, lived in different quarters and did not intermarry.[152]\n\nBritish rule\nThe British occupied Hebron on 8 December 1917.

Before his appointment, he had been a staunch opponent of Haj Amin, supported the Muslim National Associations and had good contacts with the Zionists.[155] Later, al-Kha\u1e6d\u012bb became one of the few loyal followers of Haj Amin in Hebron.[156] During the late Ottoman period, a new ruling elite had emerged in Palestine. They later formed the core of the growing Arab nationalist movement in the early 20th century. During the Mandate period, delegates from Hebron constituted only 1 per cent of the political leadership.[157] The Palestinian Arab decision to boycott the 1923 elections for a Legislative Council was made at the fifth Palestinian Congress, after it was reported by Murshid Shahin (an Arab pro-Zionist activist) that there was intense resistance in Hebron to the elections.[158] Almost no house in Hebron remained undamaged when an earthquake struck Palestine on July 11, 1927.[159]\nThe Cave of the Patriarchs continued to remain officially closed to non-Muslims, and reports that entry to the site had been relaxed in 1928 were denied by the Supreme Muslim Council.[160]\nAt this time following attempts by the Lithuanian government to draft yeshiva students into the army, the Lithuanian Hebron Yeshiva (Knesses Yisroel) relocated to Hebron, after consultations between Rabbi Nosson Tzvi Finkel, Yechezkel Sarna and Moshe Mordechai Epstein.[161]{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"title \": \"Harry H.

The sole exception was the 8th generation Hebronite Ya'akov ben Shalom Ezra, who processed dairy products in the city, blended in well with its social landscape and resided there under the protection of friends. In November 1947, in anticipation of the UN partition vote, the Ezra family closed its shop and left the city.[169] Yossi Ezra has since tried to regain his family's property through the Israeli courts.[170]\n\nJordanian rule\nAt the beginning of the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War, Egypt took control of Hebron. Between May and October, Egypt and Jordan tussled for dominance in Hebron and its environs. Both countries appointed military governors in the town, hoping to gain recognition from Hebron officials. The Egyptians managed to persuade the pro-Jordanian mayor to support their rule, at least superficially, but local opinion turned against them when they imposed taxes. Villagers surrounding Hebron resisted and skirmishes broke out in which some were killed.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"origyear\": \"2003\", \"title \": \"Terrorism and Tyranny: Trampling Freedom, Justice, and Peace to Rid the World of Evil\", \"last \": \"Bovard\", \"first\": \"James\", \"publisher \": \"[[Palgrave Macmillan]]\", \"year \": \"2004\", \"isbn   \": \"978-1-403-96682-7\", \"url \": \"https://books.google.com/books?id=VQoH4fy4m88C&pg=PA265\", \"accessdate \": \"31 July 2012\"} By late 1948, part of the Egyptian forces from Bethlehem to Hebron had been cut off from their lines of supply and Glubb Pasha sent 350 Arab Legionnaires and an armoured car unit to Hebron to reinforce them there. When the Armistice was signed, the city thus fell under Jordanian military control. The armistice agreement between Israel with Jordan intended to allow Israeli Jewish pilgrims to visit Hebron, but, as Jews of all nationalities were forbidden by Jordan into the country, this did not occur.[172][173]\nIn December 1948, the Jericho Conference was convened to decide the future of the West Bank which was held by Jordan.  Hebron notables, headed by mayor Muhamad 'Ali al-Ja'bari, voted in favour of becoming part of Jordan and to recognise Abdullah I of Jordan as their king. The subsequent unilateral annexation benefited the Arabs of Hebron, who during the 1950s, played a significant role in the economic development of Jordan.[174]{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"2007\", \"title\": \"Cities of the Middle East and North Africa: A Historical Encyclopedia\", \"url\": \"https://books.google.com/books?id=3SapTk5iGDkC&pg=PA165\", \"publisher\": \"ABC-CLIO\", \"isbn\": \"978-1-57607-919-5\", \"author1\": \"Michael Dumper\", \"author2\": \"Bruce E.

In an attempt to reach a land for peace deal, Yigal Allon proposed that Israel annex 45% of the West Bank and return the remainder to Jordan.[179] According to the Allon Plan, the city of Hebron would lie in Jordanian territory, and in order to determine Israel's own border, Allon suggested building a Jewish settlement adjacent to Hebron.[180] David Ben-Gurion also considered that Hebron was the one sector of the conquered territories that should remain under Jewish control and be open to Jewish settlement.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"title \": \"The founding myths of Israel: nationalism, socialism, and the making of the Jewish state\", \"last \": \"Sternhell\", \"first \": \"Z.\", \"authorlink \": \"Zeev Sternhell\", \"publisher \": \"Princeton University Press\", \"year \": \"1999\", \"isbn \": \"978-0-691-00967-4\", \"url \": \"https://books.google.com/books?id=LwBtJ1U5vc0C&pg=PA333&dq=\", \"accessdate \": \"26 July 2011\"} Apart from its symbolic message to the international community that Israel's rights in Hebron were, according to Jews, inalienable,[182] settling Hebron also had theological significance in some quarters.[183] For some, the capture of Hebron by Israel had unleashed a messianic fervor.[184]\nSurvivors and descendants of the prior community are mixed.

The report, based in part on over 40,000 incident reports over those 20 years, found that Israel routinely violates international law in Hebron and that it is in \"severe and regular breach\" of the rights to non-discrimination laid out in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights over the lack of freedom to movement for the Palestinian residents of Hebron. The report found that Israel is in regular violation of Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention which prohibits the deportation of civilians from occupied territory. The report also found the presence of any Israeli settlement in Hebron to violate international law.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-confidential-report-claims-israel-regularly-breaks-international-law-in-hebron-1.6747523\", \"title\": \"Confidential 20-year monitoring report: Israel regularly breaks int'l law in Hebron\", \"date\": \"2018-12-17\", \"website\": \"haaretz.com\"}\n\nIsraeli settlements\nPost-1967 settlement was impelled by theological doctrines developed in the Mercaz HaRav Kook under both its founder Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook, and his son Rabbi Zvi Yehuda Kook, according to which the Land of Israel is holy, the people, endowed with a divine spark, are holy, and that the messianic Age of Redemption has arrived, requiring that the Land and People be united in occupying the land and fulfilling the commandments. Hebron has a particular role in the unfolding 'cosmic drama': traditions hold that Abraham purchased land there, that King David was its king, and the tomb of Abraham covers the entrance to the Garden of Eden, and was a site excavated by Adam, who is buried there with Eve. Redemption will occur when the feminine and masculine characteristics of God are united at the site. Settling Hebron is not only a right and duty, but is doing the world at large a favour, with the community's acts an example of the Jews of Hebron being \"a light unto the nations\" (Or la-Goyim) [215] and bringing about their redemption, even if this means breaching secular laws, expressed in religiously motivated violence towards Palestinians, who are widely viewed as \"mendacious, vicious, self-centered, and impossible to trust\". Clashes with Palestinians in  the settlement project have theological significance in the Jewish Hebron community: the frictions of war were, in Kook's view, conducive to the messianic process, and 'Arabs' will have to leave. There is no kin connection between the new settlers and the traditional Old Families of Jewish Hebronites, who vigorously oppose the new settler presence in Hebron.[215] According to a ruling given by the Israeli Supreme Court in 2011, Jews have no right to properties they possessed in places like Hebron and Tel Rumeida before 1948, and have no right to compensation for their losses.[170]\n\nFirst settlement, Kiryat Arba\nIn the spring of 1968, Rabbi Moshe Levinger, together with a group of Israelis posing as Swiss tourists, rented from its owner Faiz Qawasmeh{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"title \": \"Byzantium; The Early Centuries Jewish Terrorism in Israel\", \"last1 \": \"Pedahzur\", \"first1 \": \"Ami\", \"last2 \": \"Perliger\", \"first2 \": \"Arie\", \"publisher \": \"Columbia University Press\", \"year \": \"2011\", \"isbn \": \"978-0-231-15447-5\", \"url \": \"https://books.google.com/books?id=DF03xwLaPucC&printsec=frontcover\", \"accessdate \": \"19 November 2012\"} the main hotel in Hebron[217] and then refused to leave. The Labor government's survival depended on the religious Zionism-associated National Religious Party and was, under pressure of this party, reluctant to evacuate the settlers. Defence Minister Moshe Dayan ordered their evacuation but agreed to their relocation to the nearby military base on the eastern outskirts of Hebron which was to become the settlement Kiryat Arba.[218] After heavy lobbying by Levinger, the settlement gained the tacit support of Levi Eshkol and Yigal Allon, while it was opposed by Abba Eban and Pinhas Sapir.[219] After more than a year and a half, the government agreed to legitimize the settlement.[220] The settlement was later expanded with the nearby outpost Givat Ha\u2019avot, north of the Cave of the Patriarchs.[218] \nMuch of the Hebron-Kiryat Arba operation was planned and financed by the Movement for Greater Israel.[221]\n\nBeit Hadassah\nOriginally named Hesed l'Avraham clinic, Beit Hadassah was constructed in 1893 with donations of Jewish Baghdadi families and was the only modern medical facility in Hebron. In 1909, it was renamed after Hadassah Women's Zionist Organization of America which took responsibility for the medical staff and provided free medical care to all.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"last1\": \"Auerbach\", \"first1\": \"Jerold S.\", \"date\": \"2009\", \"title\": \"Hebron Jews memory and conflict in the land of Israel\", \"location\": \"Lanham, Md.\", \"publisher\": \"Rowman & Littlefield\", \"page\": \"60\", \"isbn\": \"9780742566170\"}\nIn 1979, after several attempts by Israeli men had failed to succeed in taking possession of the building, then known as the Dabouia, 15 settler mothers and their 35 children drove down to it and squatted there, and managed to camp in the building for a year, exploiting the government's indecision at the time, when it was engaged in negotiations with Egypt to hand back the Sinai peninsula The calculation was that the state would 'balance out' the unpopular decision to hand back conquered territory by committing itself to greater control of the West Bank.[223] A group of settlers led by Miriam Levinger moved into the Dabouia, the former Hadassah Hospital in central Hebron, then under Arab administration. They turned it into a bridgehead for Jewish resettlement inside Hebron[224] and founded the Committee of The Jewish Community of Hebron near the Abraham Avinu Synagogue. The take-over created severe conflict with Arab shopkeepers in the same area; a retaliatory action by a Palestinian guerilla group killed six yeshiva students.[225] The shopkeepers appealed twice to the Israeli Supreme Court, without success.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"title \": \"The Occupation of Justice: The Supreme Court of Israel and the Occupied Territories\", \"last \": \"Kretzmer\", \"first \": \"D.\", \"authorlink \": \"David Kretzmer\", \"publisher \": \"SUNY Press\", \"location \": \"Albany, New York\", \"year \": \"2002\", \"isbn   \": \"978-0-7914-5338-4\", \"url \": \"https://books.google.com/books?id=acGnk-tZoOYC&pg=PA117&dq=\", \"accessdate \": \"25 July 2011\"} With this precedent, in February of the following year, the Government legitimized residency in the city of Hebron proper, allowing 50 armed families under military guard to dwell in a fortified structure in the heart of the Old City of Palestinian Hebron.[227][223] The pattern of settlement followed by an outbreak of hostilities with local Palestinians was repeated later at Tel Rumeida.[228]\n\nBeit Romano\nBeit Romano was built and owned by Yisrael Avraham Romano of Constantinople and served Sephardi Jews from Turkey. In 1901, a Yeshiva was established there with a dozen teachers and up to 60 students.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"last1\": \"Auerbach\", \"first1\": \"Jerold S.\", \"date\": \"2009\", \"title\": \"Hebron Jews memory and conflict in the land of Israel\", \"location\": \"Lanham, Md.\", \"publisher\": \"Rowman & Littlefield\", \"page\": \"60\", \"isbn\": \"9780742566170\"}\nIn 1982, Israeli authorities took over a Palestinian education office (Osama Ben Munqez School) and the adjacent bus station. The school was turned into a settlement, and the bus station into a military base against an order of the Israeli Supreme Court.[218]\n\nTel Rumeida\nIn 1807 the immigrant Sephardic Rabbi Haim Yeshua Hamitzri (Haim the Jewish Egyptian) purchased 5 dunams on the outskirts of the city and in 1811 he signed a contract for a 99-year lease on a further 800 dunams of land, which included 4 plots in Tel Rumeida. The plots were administered by his descendant Haim Bajaio after Jews left Hebron. Settlers' claims to this land are based on these precedents, but are dismissed by the rabbi's heir.[229]\nIn 1984, settlers established a caravan outpost there called (Ramat Yeshai). In 1998, the Government recognized it as a settlement, and in 2001 the Defence Minister approved the building of the first housing units.[218]\n\nAvraham Avinu\nThe Abraham Avinu Synagogue was the physical and spiritual center of its neighborhood and regarded as one of the most beautiful synagogues in Palestine. It was the centre of Jewish worship in Hebron until it was burnt down during the 1929 riots. In 1948 under Jordanian rule, the remaining ruins were razed.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"last1\": \"Auerbach\", \"first1\": \"Jerold S.\", \"date\": \"2009\", \"title\": \"Hebron Jews memory and conflict in the land of Israel\", \"location\": \"Lanham, Md.\", \"publisher\": \"Rowman & Littlefield\", \"pages\": \"40, 45, 79\", \"isbn\": \"9780742566170\"}\nThe Avraham Avinu quarter was established next to the Vegetable and Wholesale Markets on Al-Shuhada Street in the south of the Old City. The vegetable market was closed by the Israeli military and some of the neighbouring houses were occupied by settlers and soldiers. Settlers started to take over the closed Palestinian stores, despite explicit orders of the Israeli Supreme Court that the settlers should vacate these stores and the Palestinians should be allowed to return.[218]\n\nFurther settlement activities\nIn 2012, Israel Defense Forces called for the immediate removal of a new settlement, because it was seen as a provocation.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"title \": \"Palestinian In bid to revive the old city, Hebron residents put on traditional food festival\", \"last \": \"Sherlock\", \"first \": \"Ruth\", \"work \": \"Haaretz\", \"date \": \"20 November 2010\", \"url \": \"http://www.haaretz.com/culture/in-bid-to-revive-the-old-city-hebron-residents-put-on-traditional-food-festival-1.325748\", \"accessdate \": \"26 July 2011\"} The IDF has enforced settler demands against the flying of Palestinian flags on a Hebronite rooftop contiguous to settlements, though no rule forbids the practice.[232] In August 2016, Israel announced its intention to allow settlement building in the military compound of Plugat Hamitkanim in Hebron, which had been expropriated for military purposes in the 1990s.[233]\nIn late 2019, the Israeli Defense Minister Naftali Bennett instructed the military administration to inform the Palestinian municipality of the government's intention to reconstruct infrastructure in the old Hebron fruit and vegetable market in order to establish a Jewish neighbourhood there, which would allow for doubling the city's settler population. The area's original residents, who have protected tenancy rights there, were compelled to evacuate the zone after the Cave of the Patriarch's massacre. The original site was under Jewish ownership prior to 1948. The plan proposes that the empty shops remain Palestinian while the units built over them house Jewish Israelis.[234]{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"title \": \"Border Police, Hebron's substitute for summer camp counselors\", \"last \": \"Levy\", \"first \": \"G.\", \"authorlink \": \"Gideon Levy\", \"work \": \"[[Haaretz]]\", \"date \": \"31 July 2012\", \"url \": \"http://www.haaretz.com/news/features/border-police-hebron-s-substitute-for-summer-camp-counselors.premium-1.454811\", \"accessdate \": \"31 July 2012\"}[236]\n\nDemographics\nIn 1820, it was reported that there were about 1,000 Jews in Hebron.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"title \": \"Journal of a tour in the Levant\", \"last \": \"Turner\", \"first \": \"William\", \"publisher \": \"John Murray\", \"volume \": \"2\", \"year \": \"1820\", \"url \": \"https://books.google.com/books?id=yYQOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA261\", \"accessdate \": \"21 February 2012\"} In 1838, Hebron had an estimated 1,500 taxable Muslim households, in addition to 41 Jewish tax-payers. Taxpayers consisted here of male heads of households who owned even a very small shop or piece of land. 200 Jews and one Christian household were under 'European protections'. The total population was estimated at 10,000.[125] In 1842, it was estimated that about 400 Arab and 120 Jewish families lived in Hebron, the latter having been diminished in number following the destruction of 1834.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"1842\", \"title\": \"The Union Bible Dictionary\", \"url\": \"https://books.google.com/books?id=8qAaAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA304\", \"publisher\": \"American Sunday-School Union\", \"page\": \"304\", \"author1\": \"Frederick Adolphus Packard\", \"author2\": \"American Sunday-School Union\"}\n\nUrban development\nHistorically, the city consisted of four densely populated quarters: the suq and Harat al-Masharqa adjacent to the Ibrahimi mosque, the silk merchant quarter (Haret Kheitun) to the south and the Sheikh quarter (Haret al-Sheikh) to the north. It is believed the basic urban structure of the city had been established by the Mamluk period, during which time the city also had Jewish, Christian and Kurdish quarters.[264]\nIn the mid 19th-century, Hebron was still divided into four quarters, but the Christian quarter had disappeared.[264] The sections included the ancient quarter surrounding the cave of Machpelah, the Haret Kheitun (the Jewish quarter, Haret el-Yahud), the Haret el-Sheikh and the Druze quarter.[265]  As Hebron's population gradually increased, inhabitants preferred to build upwards rather than leave the safety of their neighbourhoods. By the 1880s, better security provided by the Ottoman authorities allowed the town to expand and a new commercial centre, Bab el-Zawiye, emerged.[266] As development continued, new spacious and taller structures were built to the north-west.[267] In 1918, the town consisted of dense clusters of residential dwellings along the valley, rising onto the slopes above it.[268]  By the 1920s, the town was made up of seven quarters: el-Sheikh and Bab el-Zawiye to the west, el-Kazzazin, el-Akkabi and el-Haram in the centre, el-Musharika to the south and el-Kheitun in the east.[269]  Urban sprawl had spread onto the surrounding hills by 1945.[268] The large population increase under Jordanian rule resulted in about 1,800 new houses being built, most of them along the Hebron-Jerusalem highway, stretching northwards for over 3 miles (5\u00a0km) at a depth of 600\u00a0ft (200m) either way. Some 500 houses were built elsewhere on surrounding rural land. There was less development to the south-east, where housing units extended along the valley for about 1 mile (1.5\u00a0km).{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"title \": \"Urbanization in Israel\", \"last \": \"Efrat\", \"first \": \"Elisha\", \"publisher \": \"Taylor & Francis\", \"year \": \"1984\", \"isbn \": \"9780709909316\", \"url \": \"https://books.google.com/books?id=5XwOAAAAQAAJ\"}\nIn 1971, with the assistance of the Israeli and Jordanian governments, the Hebron University, an Islamic university, was founded.[270][271]\nIn an attempt to enhance the view of the Ibrahami Mosque, Jordan demolished whole blocks of ancient houses opposite its entrance, which also resulted in improved access to the historic site.[272] The Jordanians also demolished the old synagogue located in the el-Kazzazin quarter. In 1976, Israel recovered the site which had been converted into an animal pen, and by 1989, a settler courtyard had been established there.[273]\nToday, the area along the north-south axis to the east comprises the modern town of Hebron (also called Upper Hebron, Khalil Foq). It was established towards the end of the Ottoman period, its inhabitants being upper and middle class Hebronites who from there from the crowded old city, Balde al-Qadime (also called Lower Hebron, Khalil Takht).[274] The northern part of Upper Hebron includes some up-scale residential  districts and also houses the Hebron University, private hospitals and the only two hotels in the city. The main commercial artery of the city is located here, situated along the Jerusalem Road, and includes modern multi-storey shopping malls. Also in this area are villas and apartment complexes built on the krum, rural lands and vineyards, which used to function as recreation areas during the summer months until the early Jordanian period.[274] The southern part is where the working-class neighbourhoods are located, along with large industrial zones and the Hebron Polytechnic University.[274]\nThe main municipal and governmental buildings are located in the centre of the city. This area includes high-rise concrete and glass developments and also some distinct Ottoman era one-storey family houses, adorned with arched entrances, decorative motifs and ironwork. Hebron's domestic appliance and textile markets are located here along two parallel roads which lead to the entrance of the old city.[274]  Many of these have been relocated from the old commercial centre of the city, known as the vegetable market (hesbe), which was closed down by the Israeli military during the 1990s. The vegetable market is now located in the square of Bab el-Zawiye.[274]\n\nShoe industry\nFrom the 1970s to the early 1990s, a third of those who lived in the city worked in the shoe industry. According to the shoe factory owner Tareq Abu Felat, the number reached least 35,000 people and there were more than 1,000 workshops around the city.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/inpictures/2015/03/decline-hebron-shoe-industry-150302125843692.html\", \"title\": \"The decline of Hebron's shoe industry\", \"work\": \"[[Al Jazeera]]\"} Statistics from the Chamber of Commerce in Hebron put the figure at 40,000 people employed in 1,200 shoe businesses.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/ru/originals/2013/03/palestinian-industry-suffers-cheap-imports.htm\", \"title\": \"The decline of Hebron's shoe industry\", \"work\": \"[[Al Monitor]]\"} However, the 1993 Oslo Accords and 1994 Protocol on Economic Relations between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) made it possible to mass import Chinese goods as the Palestinian National Authority, which was created after the Oslo Accords, did not regulate it.

While the Jewish leaders accepted the partition plan, the Arab leadership (the Arab Higher Committee in Palestine and the Arab League) rejected it, opposing any partition.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"2008\", \"title\": \"The Palestinian refugees in Jordan 1948\\u20131957\", \"publisher\": \"Routledge\", \"page\": \"2\", \"isbn\": \"978-0-7146-3120-2\", \"last\": \"Plascov\", \"first\": \"Avi\"}{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"1971\", \"title\": \"The Jerusalem question, 1917\\u20131968\", \"publisher\": \"Hoover Institution Press, U.S.\", \"page\": \"40\", \"isbn\": \"978-0-8179-3291-6\", \"last\": \"Bovis\", \"first\": \"H.

Following the Six-Day War of 1967, Israel occupied Hebron. In 1997, in accordance with the Hebron Agreement, Israel withdrew from 80 per cent of Hebron which was handed over to the Palestinian Authority. Palestinian police would assume responsibilities in Area H1 and Israel would retain control in Area H2.\nAn international unarmed observer force\u2014the Temporary International Presence in Hebron (TIPH) was subsequently established to help the normalization of the situation and to maintain a buffer between the Palestinian Arab population of the city and the Jewish population residing in their enclave in the old city. The TIPH operates with the permission of the Israeli government, meeting regularly with the Israeli army and the Israeli Civil Administration, and is granted free access throughout the city. In 2018, the TIPH came under criticism in Israel due to incidents where an employee was, according to the Israeli police, filmed puncturing the tires of the car of an Israeli settler, and another instance where an observer was deported after slapped a settler boy.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-confidential-report-claims-israel-regularly-breaks-international-law-in-hebron-1.6747523\", \"title\": \"Confidential 20-year monitoring report: Israel regularly breaks int'l law in Hebron\", \"date\": \"2018-12-17\", \"website\": \"haaretz.com\"}\n\nIntercommunal violence\nHebron was the one city excluded from the interim agreement of September 1995 to restore rule over all Palestinian West Bank cities to the Palestinian Authority.[203] Since The Oslo Agreement, violent episodes have been recurrent in the city. The Cave of the Patriarchs massacre took place on February 25, 1994 when Baruch Goldstein, an Israeli physician and resident of Kiryat Arba, opened fire on Muslims at prayer in the Ibrahimi Mosque, killing 29, and wounding 125 before the survivors overcame and killed him.[279] Standing orders for Israeli soldiers on duty in Hebron disallowed them from firing on fellow Jews, even if they were shooting Arabs.[280] This event was condemned by the Israeli Government, and the extreme right-wing Kach party was banned as a result.[281] The Israeli government also tightened restrictions on the movement of Palestinians in H2, closed their vegetable and meat markets, and banned Palestinian cars on Al-Shuhada Street.[282] The park near the Cave of the Patriarchs for recreation and barbecues is off-limits for Arab Hebronites.[283]\nOver the period of the First Intifada and Second Intifada, the Jewish community was subjected to attacks by Palestinian militants, especially during the periods of the intifadas; which saw 3 fatal stabbings and 9 fatal shootings in between the first and second Intifada (0.9% of all fatalities in Israel and the West Bank) and 17 fatal shootings (9 soldiers and 8 settlers) and 2 fatalities from a bombing during the second Intifada,{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Terrorism-+Obstacle+to+Peace/Palestinian+terror+before+2000/Fatal+Terrorist+Attacks+in+Israel+Since+the+DOP+-S.htm\", \"title\": \"Fatal Terrorist Attacks in Israel Since the DOP (Sep. 1993)\", \"date\": \"24 September 2000\", \"accessdate\": \"2007-04-13\"} and thousands of rounds fired on it from the hills above the Abu-Sneina and Harat al-Sheikh neighbourhoods. 12 Israeli soldiers were killed (Hebron Brigade commander Colonel Dror Weinberg and two other officers, 6 soldiers and 3 members of the security unit of Kiryat Arba) in an ambush.[285]  Two Temporary International Presence in Hebron observers were killed by Palestinian gunmen in a shooting attack on the road to Hebron[286]{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"2002-03-26\", \"title\": \"Telegraph\", \"url\": \"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1388887/Two-Norwegian-observers-killed-near-Hebron.html\", \"publisher\": \"Telegraph.co.uk\", \"accessdate\": \"2009-11-12\", \"author\": \"Published: 7:31PM GMT 26 Mar 2002\"}[288] On March 27, 2001, a Palestinian sniper targeted and killed the Jewish baby Shalhevet Pass. The sniper was caught in 2002.[citation needed]\nIn the 1980s Hebron, became the center of the Kach movement, a designated terrorist organization,[289] whose first operations started there, and provided a model for similar behaviour in other settlements.[290] Hebron is one of the three West Bank towns from where the majority of suicide bombers originate. In May 2003, three students of the Hebron Polytechnic University carried out three separate suicide attacks.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"2006\", \"title\": \"Making Sense of Suicide Missions\", \"url\": \"https://books.google.com/books?id=211orfsU0UYC\", \"publisher\": \"OUP Oxford\", \"isbn\": \"978-0-19-929797-9\", \"author\": \"Diego Gambetta\"} In August 2003, in what both Islamic groups described as a retaliation, a 29-year-old preacher from Hebron, Raed Abdel-Hamed Mesk, broke a unilateral Palestinian ceasefire by killing 23 and injured over 130 in a bus bombing in Jerusalem.[292][293]\nIsraeli organization B'Tselem states that there have been \"grave violations\" of Palestinian human rights in Hebron because of the \"presence of the settlers within the city.\" The organization cites regular incidents of \"almost daily physical violence and property damage by settlers in the city\", curfews and restrictions of movement that are \"among the harshest in the Occupied Territories\", and violence by Israeli border policemen and the IDF against Palestinians who live in the city's H2 sector.[294]{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://hrw.org/english/docs/2001/04/11/isrlpa241.htm\", \"title\": \"Mounting Human Rights Crisis in Hebron\", \"accessdate\": \"2010-03-29\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20081115080658/http://hrw.org/english/docs/2001/04/11/isrlpa241.htm\", \"archivedate\": \"2008-11-15\"}[296] According to Human Rights Watch, Palestinian areas of Hebron are frequently subject to indiscriminate firing by the IDF, leading to many casualties.[297] One former IDF soldier, with experience in policing Hebron, has testified to Breaking the Silence, that on the briefing wall of his unit a sign describing their mission aim was hung that read: \"To disrupt the routine of the inhabitants of the neighbourhood.\"[298] Hebron mayor Mustafa Abdel Nabi invited the Christian Peacemaker Teams to assist the local Palestinian community in opposition to what they describe as Israeli military occupation, collective punishment, settler harassment, home demolitions and land expropriation.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.cpt.org/publications/history.php\", \"title\": \"History/Mission of CPT\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20081011002839/http://cpt.org/publications/history.php\", \"work\": \"Christian Peacemaker Teams\"}\nA violent episode occurred on 2 May 1980, when 6 yeshiva students died, on the way home from Sabbath prayer at the Tomb of the Patriarchs, in a grenade and firearm attack.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"title \": \"Human rights in the Israeli-occupied territories, 1967\\u20131982\", \"last \": \"Cohen\", \"first \": \"Esther Rosalind\", \"publisher \": \"Manchester University Press\", \"year \": \"1985\", \"isbn \": \"978-0-7190-1726-1\", \"url \": \"https://books.google.com/books?id=awq8AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA105\", \"accessdate \": \"26 July 2011\"} The event provided a major motivation for settlers near Hebron to join the Jewish Underground.[301] On July 26, 1983, Israeli settlers attacked the Islamic University and shot three people dead and injured over thirty others.[302]\nThe 1994 Shamgar Commission of Inquiry concluded that Israeli authorities had consistently failed to investigate or prosecute crimes committed by settlers against Palestinians. Hebron IDF commander Noam Tivon said that his foremost concern is to \"ensure the security of the Jewish settlers\" and that Israeli \"soldiers have acted with the utmost restraint and have not initiated any shooting attacks or violence.\"[303]\n\nHistoric sites\nThe Old City of Hebron was a declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO on 7 July 2017,{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"7 July 2017\", \"title\": \"UNESCO declares Hebron, West Bank, a world heritage site\", \"url\": \"https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2017/07/07/UNESCO-declares-Hebron-West-Bank-a-world-heritage-site/3011499431429/\", \"language\": \"English\", \"publisher\": \"UPI\", \"last\": \"Adamczyk\", \"first\": \"Ed\"} despite opposition from Israeli officials who objected to it not being called Israeli or Jewish.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"7 July 2017\", \"title\": \"Israelis outraged by UNESCO decision on Hebron holy site\", \"url\": \"http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/unesco-puts-city-hebron-heritage-danger-list-48495103\", \"work\": \"Associated Press\", \"publisher\": \"ABC News\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20170707222506/http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/unesco-puts-city-hebron-heritage-danger-list-48495103\", \"archivedate\": \"7 July 2017\", \"accessdate\": \"8 July 2017\"}\nThe most famous historic site in Hebron is the Cave of the Patriarchs. The Herodian era structure is said to enclose the tombs of the biblical Patriarchs and Matriarchs. The Isaac Hall now serves as the Ibrahimi mosque, while the Abraham and Jacob Hall serve as a synagogue. The tombs of other biblical figures (Abner ben Ner, Otniel ben Kenaz, Ruth and Jesse) are also located in the city.\nThe Oak of Sibta (Oak of Abraham) is an ancient tree which, in non-Jewish tradition,[306] is said to mark the place where Abraham pitched his tent. The Russian Orthodox Church owns the site and the nearby Abraham's Oak Holy Trinity Monastery, consecrated in 1925.\nHebron is one of the few cities to have preserved its Mamluk architecture. Many structures were built during the period, especially Sufi zawiyas.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"2004\", \"title\": \"Pilgrimage, sciences and Sufism: Islamic art in the West Bank and Gaza\", \"url\": \"https://books.google.com/books?id=bqMVAQAAIAAJ\", \"publisher\": \"\\u00c9disud\", \"isbn\": \"978-9953-36-064-5\", \"author\": \"Museum With No Frontiers\"} Mosques from the era include the Sheikh Ali al-Bakka and Al-Jawali mosque. The early Ottoman Abraham Avinu Synagogue in the city's historic Jewish quarter was built in 1540 and restored in 1738.\n\nReligious traditions\nSome Jewish traditions regarding Adam place him in Hebron after his expulsion from Eden. Another has Cain kill Abel there. A third has Adam and Eve buried in the cave of Machpelah. A Jewish-Christian tradition had it that Adam was formed from the red clay of the field of Damascus, near Hebron.[308][309] During the Middle Ages, pilgrims and the inhabitants of Hebron would eat the red earth as a charm against misfortune.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"2008\", \"title\": \"The Fortress of the Raven: Karak in the Middle Islamic Period (1100 -1650)\", \"url\": \"https://books.google.com/books?id=y7w7TW4NVBcC&pg=PA119\", \"publisher\": \"BRILL\", \"isbn\": \"978-90-04-16519-9\", \"author\": \"Marcus Milwright\"}{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"2003\", \"title\": \"Encyclopedia of Religions Or Faiths of Man 1906, Part 2\", \"url\": \"https://books.google.com/books?id=7jz-6wHrg2QC&pg=PA220\", \"publisher\": \"Kessinger Publishing\", \"isbn\": \"978-0-7661-4308-1\", \"author\": \"J.

It is thus possibly the birthplace of John the Baptist.[313][314]\nOne Islamic tradition has it that the Prophet alighted in Hebron during his night journey from Mecca to Jerusalem, and the mosque in the city is said to conserve one of his shoes.[315] Another tradition states that the prophet Muhammad arranged for Hebron and its surrounding villages to become part of Tamim al-Dari's domain; this was implemented during Umar's reign as caliph. According to the arrangement, al-Dari and his descendants were only permitted to tax the residents for their land and the waqf of the Ibrahimi Mosque was entrusted to them.[316]\nThe simat al-Khalil or \"Table of Abraham\" is attested to in the writings of the 11th century Persian traveller Nasir-i Khusraw. According to the account, this early Islamic food distribution center \u2014 which predates the Ottoman imarets \u2014 gave all visitors to Hebron a loaf of bread, a bowl of lentils in olive oil, and some raisins.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"page\": \"73\", \"publisher \": \"Routledge\", \"isbn \": \"978-1-136-49894-7\", \"last \": \"Woodhead\", \"first \": \"Christine\", \"title \": \"The Ottoman World\"}\n\nTwin towns/Sister cities\nHebron is twinned with:\n\nBibliography\n\n\n",
