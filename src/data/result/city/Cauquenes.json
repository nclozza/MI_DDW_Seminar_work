They lived to the south of the Maule River and north of the Itata River and owned a settlement in the place where the city lies today. The city of Cauquenes was founded on May 9, 1742, de \"Villa of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de las Mercedes de Jos\u00e9 de Manso del Tutuv\u00e9n\", in the land located between the rivers Tutuv\u00e9n and Cauquenes, that the Promaucae cacique (chieftain) Ascensio Gald\u00e1mez and his wife Micaela de Araya donated to the Kingdom of Spain. Cauquenes' founder was the then Governor of the Kingdom of Chile, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Manso de Velasco. The name of the city changed with time. With the law of 20 August 1826, which created the Maule Province, it became called \"Villa de Cauquenes\", and finally on 22 December of that year, it acquired the title of \"Cauquenes\".\nCauquenes is a toponym from the term \"cauque\", a salmonid species extinct today that inhabited the rivers of the area.\n\n27 February 2010 earthquake\nCauquenes was damaged by the 8.8 magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami. Restoring power in the city in the immediate aftermath was impossible because of damage from the tsunami.[8]\n\nDemography\nAccording to the 2002 census of the National Statistics Institute, Cauquenes spans an area of 2,126.3\u00a0km2 (821\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) and has 41,217 inhabitants (20,092 men and 21,125 women).
