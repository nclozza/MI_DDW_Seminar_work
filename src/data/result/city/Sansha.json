This coincided with the establishment of Hainan as a separate administrative region. In September 1988,the authority's name was officially changed to the \"Hainan Province Paracels, Spratlys, and Zhongsha Islands Authority\". On 25 December 2006, Woody Island 'census-town's' first-ever \"Residents' and Fishermen's Congress\" was held. Three representatives at the township and village levels were selected to represent the census-town's Neighborhood Committee of the North and South Villages. The Neighborhood Committee began work on Woody Island the following day with an office at the Border Guards of the Paracels' Police Station. These were the first ever actual subdivisions created within the county-level authority.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.bjreview.com.cn/Cover_Stories_Series_2012/2012-07/03/content_464506.htm\", \"title\": \"China's Jurisdiction over the South China Sea\"}\nThe prospect of the establishment of a \"city\" on Woody Island was first publicized on 19 November 2007 in a report by Mingpao, a Hong Kong-based newspaper, through a telephone interview with a Mr. Zhang of the Propaganda Department of Wenchang, Hainan. This report claimed that a county-level city was to be established by the PRC State Council in November 2007 to administer three disputed archipelagos in the South China Sea:{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"4 December 2007\", \"title\": \"Vietnam, China: The Dispute over Significant Waterways\", \"url\": \"http://www.stratfor.com/products/premium/read_article.php?id=299411&selected=Analyses\", \"work\": \"Free Intelligence Reports\", \"publisher\": \"[[Stratfor]]\"} the Paracel Islands, Macclesfield Bank (Zhongsha Islands) and the Spratly Islands.

The troops would be responsible for managing the city's national defence mobilisation, military reserve, and carrying out military operations.[14]\nOn 24 July 2012, the PRC officially established the city of Sansha in Yongxing Island.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"24 July 2012\", \"title\": \"China establishes Sansha City\", \"url\": \"http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2012-07/24/c_131734893.htm\", \"publisher\": \"Xinhua\"}\n\nAdministrative divisions\nSansha City has two districts, Xisha District and Nansha District.

They tend to practice fishing, and selling products to the occasional cruise ship (MV Qionghai 3 and MV Sansha 1) whose tourists visit the island.
