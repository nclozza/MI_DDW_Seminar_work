    "content": "Bagepalli\n\nBagepalli  is a town municipal council in Chikballapur district  in the state of Karnataka, India. Bagepalli is situated 100\u00a0km north of Bangalore on the Bangalore-Hyderabad National Highway. The region is just below the southern border of the Rayalaseema  in Andhra Pradesh, South India. It is semi-arid and drought prone with 535\u00a0mm of erratic and spatial rainfall.[1]\n\nGeography\nBagepalli is located at 13\u00b047\u2032N 77\u00b047\u2032E\ufeff / \ufeff13.78\u00b0N 77.79\u00b0E\ufeff / 13.78; 77.79.[2] It has an average elevation of 707\u00a0metres (2319\u00a0ft).\nThe region is a semi arid drought prone one with low, erratic and spatial rainfall. The dust brown rocky terrain is severely undulating, with small hill ranges and outcrops that stud the topography. There is no mineral wealth and only a very thin and fragile soil cover.\nAn adverse land:person ratio creates a strong thirst for cultivable land since less than one-half of the total land is fit for cultivation, with the remaining taken over by the hills and rocky fields. Hardly 5% of the cropped lands are irrigated by an age old network of rain-fed tanks (small lakes), each irrigating 2 to 10 hectares of wet land. The low water table is tapped through bore-wells drilled to more than 100 meters depth. Even these dry up in the summer months, from April to September every year, when temperatures rise to a dry heat of 38 \u00b0C.\nThe average rainfall is 535\u00a0mm a year and this is, moreover, erratic and spatial. As a result there is only 1 rain-fed crop a year, whose stand is from late June till December. Groundnuts are grown on these dry lands, inter-cropped with red gram, cowpea, field beans, green gram, jowar, maize and castor on the field bunds. Irrigated groundnut, mulberry, onions and sunflower are the common bore-well irrigated crops. Ragi (golden millet) and a coarse variety of paddy are cultivated under irrigation tanks. Every fifth or sixth year is a drought, followed by near famine conditions.\nSeasonal migration by agricultural labourers is an annual occurrence during the summer months. They come back every June/July to scratch a subsistence cultivation from small patches of scattered holdings, far away from the villages and hugging the hillsides, averaging 2.6 acres (11,000\u00a0m2) per Coolie family.\n\nDemographics\nBagepalli is a Town Municipal Council city situated in Bagepalli taluka of Chikkaballapura district. The Bagepalli city is divided into 23 wards for which elections are held every 5 years. As per the Population Census 2011, there are total 6,266 families residing in the Bagepalli city. The total population of Bagepalli is 27,011 out of which 13,903 are males and 13,108 are females thus the Average Sex Ratio of Bagepalli is 943.\nThe population of Children of age 0-6 years in Bagepalli city is 3037 which is 11% of the total population. There are 1577 male children and 1460 female children between the age 0-6 years. Thus as per the Census 2011 the Child Sex Ratio of Bagepalli is 926 which is less than Average Sex Ratio (943).\nAs per the Census 2011, the literacy rate of Bagepalli is 82.2%. Thus Bagepalli has higher literacy rate compared to 69.8% of Chikkaballapura district. The male literacy rate is 87.55% and the female literacy rate is 76.61% in Bagepalli.\n\nPlaces of Interest Nearby[3]{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.censusindia.net/results/town.php?stad=A&state5=999\", \"title\": \"Census of India 2001: Data from the 2001 Census, including cities, villages and towns  (Provisional)\", \"publisher\": \"Census Commission of India\", \"accessdate\": \"2008-11-01\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20040616075334/http://www.censusindia.net/results/town.php?stad=A&state5=999\", \"archivedate\": \"2004-06-16\"}\nGummanayakana Palya - 20\u00a0km from Bagepalli\nThe palayapat of Gummanayakana Palya (also referred to as Gummanayakapalyam), to the northeast of Chikballapur, comprised the whole of the Bagepalli taluk in the far east of Mysore State and portions of the neighboring Hindupur and Kandukur taluks in the Presidency of Madras. It was founded in the second half of the 13th century by Khadripathi Nayaka (ob. 1272), a scion of a royal family in Cuddappah, who gradually established his ascendancy over the zamindars and the people of Pathapalya. He built a new capital in Devarajapalli and extended his rule over a wide area. Chinama Nayaka, his son (r. 1272-1296), named his principality after Gumma Reddy, one of the zamindars who had turned over his estates to Khadripathi Nayaka. He is also credited with having established an administrative system. Gumma Nayaka, the third ruler, (r. 1296-1314) had to submit to Anegundi and agree to pay tribute and provide military service. The sixth ruler, Kadarappa Nayaka (r. 1363-1388) helped the empire of Vijayanagar establish its control over the local polegars; for two centuries thereafter the polegars of Gummanayakana Palya were counted among the most loyal and distinguished chiefs under the kings of Vijayanagar. \nThe battle of Talikota (1565) occurred during the rule of Viradasappa Nayaka (r. 1548-1584), the 19th polegar. While other Vijayanagar feudatories took advantage of this signal defeat to break free, \"the poligar of Gummanayakana Palya, true to his traditional loyalty, remained firm under the banner of the fallen House of Vijayanagar.\" During the succession wars of the early 1630s, Palegar Vasanta Nayaka refused to acknowledge Emperor Venkata Deva Raya III. Immadi Kempe Gowda of Bangalore, the emperor champion, laid waste the palegar's lands and forced him to submit. But after some time, even tribute stopped being collected by the increasingly ineffective rulers of Vijayanagar, and Gummanayakana Palya came under Moghul rule during the reign of Bangara Thimma Nayaka (r. 1680-1728). His successor Kadarappa Nayaka III (r. 1728-1740) had to switch allegiance to the Marathas and pay heavy tribute to the Peshwa. Narasimha Nayaka V (r. 1740-1760) was forced to cede part of his territories to Murarirao Ghorpade of Gooty (q.v.) and was later brought under tribute to Hyder Ali of Mysore, who nevertheless befriended him against his own subordinates. Tippu Sultan, however, embarked on a systematic policy of extermination of the palegars. Several small principalities were annexed and, despite Palegar Narasimha Nayaka VI's (r. 1765-1802) \"protestations of loyalty for generations to the Sultan of Mysore,\" his palayapat was invaded, the palegar and his family fleeing the country ahead of Tippu's troops. Narasimha was briefly restored during the Third Mysore War, but when peace was concluded in 1793, he was again dispossessed by the vengeful Tippu. During the Fourth Mysore War (1799), Narasimha Nayaka VI, with a large army of his own, joined the British in their final assault on Sringapatam. Promises made by the English commander to restore his palayapat after final victory over Tippu were not honored by Dewan Purneya of the restored Wadiyars of Mysore. Narasimha was forced to go into exile once more \"where he, the last Paligar to rule the ancient Palayapat [of] Gummanayakana Palya, died of grief.\"\nDevaragudipalli,\nPopularly known as gadidam is a village and grama panchayat where a temple dedicated to lord Venkateshwara is situated in the outskirts of Bagepalli, construction of temple done in the period of krishna devaraya king of vijayanagara.\nSunkulamma Temple,\nIt is situated on the Bangalore - Hyderabad highway, a temple dedicated to Sri Sunkulamma Devi, 8\u00a0km from Bagepalli\n\nSee also\n- Billur, Chakavelu, Chelur, Rashcheruvu, Puligal, Naremaddepalli, Pathapalya, M Nallagutlapalli, Somanathapura, Julapalya, Polanayakanhalli, Mittemari, Yellampalli, Kanagamakalapalli, Devaragudipalli, Paragodu, Gantamvaripalli, Nallapareddipalli, Kothakote, Gulur, Gorthapalli, Thimmampalli\n",
