Ctesiphon and its environs were therefore sometimes referred to as \"The Cities\" (Aramaic: Mahuza, Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062f\u0627\u0626\u0646\u200e, al-Mada'in). In the late sixth and early seventh century, it was listed as the largest city in the world by some accounts.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://geography.about.com/library/weekly/aa011201a.htm\", \"title\": \"Largest Cities Through History\", \"publisher\": \"geography.about.com\", \"accessdate\": \"25 November 2015\"}\nDuring the Roman\u2013Parthian Wars, Ctesiphon fell three times to the Romans, and later fell twice during Sasanian rule. It was also the site of the Battle of Ctesiphon in 363 AD. After the Muslim invasion the city fell into decay and was depopulated by the end of the eighth century, its place as a political and economic center taken by the Abbasid capital at Baghdad. The most conspicuous structure remaining today is the Taq Kasra, sometimes called the Archway of Ctesiphon.{\"citetype\": \"journal\", \"year\": \"1941\", \"title\": \"The Date of the \\u1e6c\\u0101q i Kisr\\u0101\", \"journal\": \"[[The Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland]]\", \"volume\": \"73\", \"pages\": \"37\\u201341\", \"jstor\": \"25221709\", \"author\": \"Kurz, Otto\", \"series \": \"(New Series)\", \"number\": \"1\"}\n\nNames\nThe Latin name Ctesiphon derives from Ancient Greek Kt\u0113siph\u00f4n (\u039a\u03c4\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03c6\u1ff6\u03bd). This is ostensibly a Greek toponym based on a personal name, although it may be a Hellenized form of a local name, reconstructed as Tisf\u014dn or Tisb\u014dn.[5] In Iranian-language texts of the Sasanian era, it is spelled as tyspwn, which can be read as T\u012bsf\u014dn, T\u0113sif\u014dn, etc. in Manichaean Parthian \ud802\udee4\ud802\udecf\ud802\uded8\ud802\udedb\ud802\udec7\ud802\uded7, in Middle Persian \ud802\udf72\ud802\udf69\ud802\udf6e\ud802\udf6f\ud802\udf65\ud802\udf6d and in Christian Sogdian (in Syriac alphabet) languages.

Ctesiphon is first mentioned in the Book of Ezra[7] of the Old Testament as Kasfia/Casphia (a derivative of the ethnic name, Cas, and a cognate of Caspian and Qazvin). It is also mentioned in the Talmud as Aktisfon {\"citetype\": \"book\", \"title\": \"Talmud Bavli Tractate Gittin\", \"pages\": \"6A\"}.\n\nLocation\nCtesiphon is located approximately at Al-Mada'in, 32\u00a0km (20\u00a0mi) southeast of the modern city of Baghdad, Iraq, along the river Tigris. Ctesiphon measured 30 square kilometers, more than twice the surface of 13.7-square-kilometer fourth-century imperial Rome.[citation needed]\nThe archway of Chosroes (Taq Kasra) was once a part of the royal palace in Ctesiphon and is estimated to date between the 3rd and 6th centuries AD.[9] It is located in what is now the Iraqi town of Salman Pak.\n\nParthian period\nCtesiphon was founded in the late 120s BC. It was built on the site of a military camp established across from Seleucia by Mithridates I of Parthia. The reign of Gotarzes I saw Ctesiphon reach a peak as a political and commercial center. The city became the Empire's capital circa 58\u00a0BC during the reign of Orodes II. Gradually, the city merged with the old Hellenistic capital of Seleucia and other nearby settlements to form a cosmopolitan metropolis.[10]\nThe reason for this westward relocation of the capital could have been in part due to the proximity of the previous capitals (Mithradatkirt, and Hecatompylos at Hyrcania) to the Scythian incursions.[10]\nStrabo abundantly describes the foundation of Ctesiphon:\nIn ancient times Babylon was the metropolis of Assyria; but now Seleucia is the metropolis, I mean the Seleucia on the Tigris, as it is called. Nearby is situated a village called Ctesiphon, a large village. This village the kings of the Parthians were wont to make their winter residence, thus sparing the Seleucians, in order that the Seleucians might not be oppressed by having the Scythian folk or soldiery quartered amongst them. Because of the Parthian power, therefore, Ctesiphon is a city rather than a village; its size is such that it lodges a great number of people, and it has been equipped with buildings by the Parthians themselves; and it has been provided by the Parthians with wares for sale and with the arts that are pleasing to the Parthians; for the Parthian kings are accustomed to spend the winter there because of the salubrity of the air, but they summer at Ecbatana and in Hyrcania because of the prevalence of their ancient renown.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/16A*.html\", \"title\": \"LacusCurtius \\u2022 Strabo's Geography \\u2014 Book XVI Chapter 1, 16\", \"publisher\": \"penelope.uchicago.edu\", \"accessdate\": \"25 November 2015\"}Because of its importance, Ctesiphon was a major military objective for the leaders of the Roman Empire in their eastern wars. The city was captured by Rome five times in its history \u2013 three times in the 2nd century alone. The emperor Trajan captured Ctesiphon in 116, but his successor, Hadrian, decided to willingly return Ctesiphon in 117 as part of a peace settlement. The Roman general Avidius Cassius captured Ctesiphon in 164 during another Parthian war, but abandoned it when peace was concluded. In 197, the emperor Septimius Severus sacked Ctesiphon and carried off thousands of its inhabitants, whom he sold into slavery.\n\nSasanian period\nBy 226, Ctesiphon was in the hands of the Sasanian Empire, who also made it their capital and had laid an end to the Parthian dynasty of Iran. Ctesiphon was greatly enlarged and flourished during their rule, thus turning into a metropolis, which was known by in Arabic as al-Mada'in, and in Aramaic as Mahoze.{\"citetype\": \"encyclopedia\", \"ref\": \"harv\", \"article \": \"MAD\\u0100\\u02beEN\", \"last \": \"Morony\", \"first \": \"Michael\", \"url \": \"http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/madaen-sasanian-metropolitan-area\", \"encyclopedia  \": \"Encyclopaedia Iranica\", \"year \": \"2009\"} The oldest inhabited places of Ctesiphon were on its eastern side, which in Islamic Arabic sources is called \"the Old City\" (\u0645\u062f\u064a\u0646\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u062a\u064a\u0642\u0629 Mad\u012bnah al-'At\u012bqah), where the residence of the Sasanians, known as the White Palace (\u0642\u0635\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0628\u064a\u0636), was located. The southern side of Ctesiphon was known as Asb\u0101nbar or Asp\u0101nbar, which was known by its prominent halls, riches, games, stables, and baths. Taq Kasra was located in the latter.{\"citetype\": \"encyclopedia\", \"ref\": \"harv\", \"article \": \"MAD\\u0100\\u02beEN\", \"last \": \"Morony\", \"first \": \"Michael\", \"url \": \"http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/madaen-sasanian-metropolitan-area\", \"encyclopedia  \": \"Encyclopaedia Iranica\", \"year \": \"2009\"}{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"last1\": \"Houtsma\", \"first1\": \"M.

In 295, emperor Galerius was defeated outside the city. However, he returned a year later with a vengeance and won a victory which ended in the fifth and final capture of the city by the Romans in 299. He returned it to the Persian king Narses in exchange for Armenia and western Mesopotamia. In c. 325 and again in 410, the city, or the Greek colony directly across the river, was the site of church councils for the Church of the East.[citation needed]\nAfter the conquest of Antioch in 541, Khosrau I built a new city near Ctesiphon for the inhabitants he captured. He called this new city Weh Antiok Khusrau, or literally, \"better than Antioch Khosrau built this.\"[15] Local inhabitants of the area called the new city Rumagan, meaning \"town of the Romans\" and Arabs called the city al-Rumiyya. Along with Weh Antiok, Khosrau built a number of fortified cities.[16] Khosrau I deported 292,000 citizens, slaves, and conquered people to this new city in 542.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"1993\", \"title\": \"The Decline of Iranshahr: Irrigation and Environments in the History of the Middle East, 500 B.C. to A.D. 1500\", \"location\": \"Copenhagen\", \"publisher\": \"Museum Tusculanum Press\", \"isbn\": \"87-7289-259-5\", \"last\": \"Christensen\"}\nIn 590, a member of the House of Mihran, Bahram Chobin repelled the newly ascended Sasanian ruler Khosrau II from Iraq, and conquered the region. One year later, Khosrau II, with aid from the Byzantine Empire, reconquered his domains. During his reign, some of the great fame of al-Mada'in decreased, due to the popularity of Khosrau's new winter residence, Dastagerd.{\"citetype\": \"encyclopedia\", \"ref\": \"harv\", \"last \": \"Shapur Shahbazi\", \"first  \": \"A.\", \"title \": \"SASANIAN DYNASTY\", \"url \": \"http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/sasanian-dynasty\", \"year \": \"2005\", \"encyclopedia \": \"Encyclopaedia Iranica, Online Edition\", \"accessdate \": \"30 March 2014\"} In 627, the Byzantine Emperor Heraclius surrounded the city, the capital of the Sassanid Empire, leaving it after the Persians accepted his peace terms.

Ctesiphon then continued to be involved in constant fighting between two factions of the Sasanian Empire, the Pahlav (Parthian) faction under the House of Ispahbudhan and the Parsig (Persian) faction under Piruz Khosrow. \nDownfall of the Sasanians and the Islamic conquests\nIn the mid-630s, the Muslim Arabs, who had invaded the territories of the Sasanian Empire, defeated them during a great battle known as the Battle of al-Q\u0101disiyyah.{\"citetype\": \"encyclopedia\", \"ref\": \"harv\", \"article \": \"MAD\\u0100\\u02beEN\", \"last \": \"Morony\", \"first \": \"Michael\", \"url \": \"http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/madaen-sasanian-metropolitan-area\", \"encyclopedia  \": \"Encyclopaedia Iranica\", \"year \": \"2009\"} The Arabs then attacked Ctesiphon, and occupied it in early 637.\nThe Muslim military officer Sa`d ibn Abi Waqqas quickly seized Valashabad and made a peace treaty with the inhabitants of Weh Antiok Khusrau and Veh-Ardashir. The terms of the treaty were that the inhabitants of Weh Antiok Khusrau were allowed to leave if they wanted to, but if they did not, they were forced to acknowledge Muslim authority, and also pay tribute (jizya). Later on, when the Muslims arrived at Ctesiphon, it was completely desolated, due to flight of the Sasanian royal family, nobles, and troops. However, the Muslims had managed to take some of troops captive, and many riches were seized from the Sasanian treasury and were given to the Muslim troops.{\"citetype\": \"encyclopedia\", \"ref\": \"harv\", \"article \": \"MAD\\u0100\\u02beEN\", \"last \": \"Morony\", \"first \": \"Michael\", \"url \": \"http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/madaen-sasanian-metropolitan-area\", \"encyclopedia  \": \"Encyclopaedia Iranica\", \"year \": \"2009\"} Furthermore, the throne hall in Taq Kasra was briefly used as a mosque.[19]\nStill, as political and economic fortune had passed elsewhere, the city went into a rapid decline, especially after the founding of the Abbasid capital at Baghdad in the 8th century, and soon became a ghost town. Caliph Al-Mansur took much of the required material for the construction of Baghdad from the ruins of Ctesiphon. He also attempted to demolish the palace and reuse its bricks for his own palace, but he desisted only when the undertaking proved too vast.[20] Al-Mansur also used the al-Rumiya town as the Abbasid capital city for a few months.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"last1\": \"Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland\", \"date\": \"1895\", \"title\": \"Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain & Ireland\", \"language\": \"en\", \"publisher\": \"Cambridge University Press for the Royal Asiatic Society\", \"page\": \"40\"}\nIt is believed to be the basis for the city of Isbanir in One Thousand and One Nights.\n\nModern era\nThe ruins of Ctesiphon were the site of a major battle of World War I in November 1915. The Ottoman Empire defeated troops of Britain attempting to capture Baghdad, and drove them back some 40 miles (64\u00a0km) before trapping the British force and compelling it to surrender.\n\nPopulation and religion\nUnder Sasanian rule, the population of Ctesiphon was heavily mixed: it included Arameans, Persians, Greeks and Assyrians. Several religions were also practiced in the metropolis, which included Christianity, Judaism and Zoroastrianism. In 497, the first Nestorian patriarch Mar Babai I, fixed his see at Seleucia-Ctesiphon, supervising their mission east, with the Merv metropolis as pivot. The population also included Manicheans, a Dualist church, who continued to be mentioned in Ctesiphon during Umayyad rule fixing their 'patriarchate of Babylon' there.{\"citetype\": \"encyclopedia\", \"ref\": \"harv\", \"article \": \"MAD\\u0100\\u02beEN\", \"last \": \"Morony\", \"first \": \"Michael\", \"url \": \"http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/madaen-sasanian-metropolitan-area\", \"encyclopedia  \": \"Encyclopaedia Iranica\", \"year \": \"2009\"} Much of the population fled from Ctesiphon after the Arab capture of the metropolis.
