A brick of Amar-Sin was also found at the site. Mashkan-shapir achieved prominence during the Old Babylonian period. This time of occupation is considered to begin with the construction of the city walls by Sin-Iddinam of Larsa. The city was abandoned during the reign of Samsu-iluna, successor to Hammurabi of the First Babylonian dynasty and not re-occupied until late in the first millennium. The city's demise was part of a general collapse and abandonment of sites in the region at that time.\nAfter rising to importance under the Larsa city-state, Mashkan-shapir became part of the Babylonian empire after the defeat of Larsa by Hammurabi following a long siege. At the time, Babylon and Larsa were engaged in a struggle for dominance in the region.[1]\nNote that the modern name of the site is in some doubt. Other possible names are Ishan Chebir and Tell Naim. The Tell Abu Duwari identification was the first and is used in archaeological publications.\n\nArchaeology\nThe site of Mashkan-shapir covers about 56 hectares and is divided into\na number of sections by the beds of ancient canals and rivers. It is\nespecially important from an archaeological standpoint because it is\na single level site. Most cities in the Ancient Near East have been\nbuilt and rebuilt many times over history, obscuring our understanding\nof individual time periods.\nTell Abu Duwari was first noted, as site 639, in the Nippur survey of Robert McCormick Adams of the Oriental Institute at the University of Chicago.\n[2]\nThe site was excavated for a total of five months in three seasons between 1987 and 1990 by an American Schools of Oriental Research and National Geographic Society team led by Elizabeth Stone and Paul Zimansky.\n[3]\n[4]\nA key find was that of foundation deposits commemorating the city walls\nbeing built by Sin-Iddinam, which allowed the city to be identified. As part\nof the work, satellite images were taken and a complete surface\nmapping was made using a kite lofted camera and coordinate markers.\nExcavations at Mashkan-shapir ended with the invasion of Kuwait by\nIraq in 1990, interrupting a planned long term research program.\nSubsequently, the site has been heavily looted to the point where any\nfurther archaeological work would probably be pointless.\n",
