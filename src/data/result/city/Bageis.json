Since there is no evidence of a bishopric of that name, Janin (1931),[1] following Adolf von Harnack,[6] consider \"Baris\" to be an error for \"Bagis\", while P\u00e9trird\u00e8s (1907), who cites Heinrich Gelzer and C. H. Turner, does not accept that correction.[2] Other known bishops of Bagis are Chrysapius or Chrysanthus, who was at the Robber Council of Ephesus in 449, Leonides, who was a signatory of the joint letter that the bishops of Lydia sent in 459 to Byzantine Emperor Leo I the Thracian with regard to the murder of Proterius of Alexandria, and Basilius and Clemens, who were at the Council of Constantinople (879),[7] presumably one of them ordained by Patriarch Ignatius of Constantinople, the other by Photius.[1][2]\nBagis must have disappeared as a residential see during the Turkish-Byzantine wars, perhaps in the 12th century, although it continued to be listed in Notitiae Episcopatuum.[1]\nNo longer a residential bishopric, Bagis is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.[8] a list of titular bishops includes:\n\nReferences\n\u00a0This article\u00a0incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain:\u00a0Smith, William, ed.
