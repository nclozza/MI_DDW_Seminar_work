The Delhi Sultanate and later Mughal Empire ruled the region. The Punjab region became predominantly Muslim due to missionary Sufi saints whose dargahs dot the landscape of Punjab region.\nThe name 'Qadirabad' comes from the name of Mirza Qadir Khan, whose grave and that of his brother's grave are in Qadirabad. A wall was built enclosing the city between 1556\u20131605 with three gateways.\nAfter the decline of the Mughal Empire, the Sikh Empire invaded and occupied Mandi Bahauddin District. The Muslims faced restrictions during the Sikh rule.[citation needed] During the period of British rule, Bahawalnagar increased in population and importance.\nThe predominantly Muslim population supported Muslim League and Pakistan Movement. After the independence of Pakistan in 1947, the minority Hindus and Sikhs migrated to India while the Muslims refugees from India settled down in the Mandi Bahauddin District.\nNow these days the most strong family with respect of Political Views. The Family of Fazal Hussain Gujjar is the most strongest in the Whole Mandibhudin District since 1947. The major names of Gujjar Family who are representing in Politics are Farooq Ahmed Gujjar, Sajid Ahmed, Hafiz Maqsood Ahmed Gujjar, Osama Farooq, Zubair Farooq and Adil Maqsood. From our sources In the upcoming Local Bodies Election Adil Maqsood will stand for the seat of Chairman and Zubair Farooq will stand for the Seat of Vice-Chairman representing PML-Q.\n\nDemographics\nThe population of Qadirabad was calculated to be 102,555 in 2014 (10,186 in 1998).{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"title \": \"Qadirabad\", \"work \": \"World Gazetteer\", \"url \": \"http://world-gazetteer.com/wg.php?x=&men=gpro&lng=en&dat=32&geo=-76666&srt=npan&col=aohdq\", \"accessdate \": \"2007-10-28\", \"archiveurl \": \"https://archive.today/20130209134349/http://world-gazetteer.com/wg.php?x=&men=gpro&lng=en&dat=32&geo=-76666&srt=npan&col=aohdq\", \"archivedate \": \"2013-02-09\", \"urlstatus \": \"dead\"}\n\nGeography\nThe Chenab River is less than five kilometres to the south of Qadirabad. The nearest cities are Phalia, about 20 kilometres away, Mandi Bahauddin, about 40 kilometres away, and Gujrat, about 70 kilometres away. Sialkot International Airport is about 115\u00a0km from Qadirabad. Sargodha from Qadirabad through Bhalwal is ~ 98 kilometres and through Sial More is about 105\u00a0km. Faisalabad through motorway M-3 is ~ 165\u00a0km . Allama Iqbal International Airport Lahore from Qadirabad is ~210\u00a0km through motorway and is ~180\u00a0km through Gujranwala. Old Ravi bridge Lahore from Qadirabad is ~ 150\u00a0km through Gujranwala and is 185\u00a0km through Motorway. Benazir Bhutto International Airport Islamabad/Rawalpindi is ~ 255\u00a0km through Motorway, ~ 200\u00a0km through Mandi Bahauddin (at night not safe to travel this road) and ~ 230\u00a0km through Gujrat (relatively safe to travel at night). Hafizabad is about 65\u00a0km through Qadirabad headworks. Aerial distance of Hafizabad from Qadirabad through Vanike Tarar is about 30\u00a0km but there is no bridge on the river Chenab in between. If the Chinab river is dry then Hafizabad is about 6 to 7 hours walking distance from Qadirabad. That is reason to give big benefit to the people of Tehsil Phalia/Qadirabad and the people of District Hafizabad, a bridge in between Qadirabad and Vanike Tarar on the River Chenab is recommended to connect the people of two districts more closer. It will also make easier to the people of Tehsil Phalia to travel to Lahore through Motorway.\n\nTransport\nThe nearest railway station is located at Mandi Bahauddin. The nearest international airports are located at Lahore, Faisalabad, Sialkot and Islamabad, which are each about three to four hours drive away.
