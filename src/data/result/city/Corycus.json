In antiquity, Corycus was an important harbor and commercial town. It was the port of Seleucia, where, in 191 BCE, the fleet of Antiochus the Great was defeated by the Romans. In the Roman times it preserved its ancient laws; the emperors usually kept a fleet there to watch over the pirates. Corycus was also a mint in antiquity and some of its coins survive.\nCorycus was controlled by the Byzantine Empire.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"last1\": \"Edwards\", \"first1\": \"Robert W., &quot;Korykos&quot;\", \"date\": \"2016\", \"title\": \"The Eerdmans Encyclopedia of Early Christian Art and Archaeology, ed., Paul Corby Finney\", \"location\": \"Grand Rapids, Michigan\", \"publisher\": \"William B.

The admiral Eustathios Kymineianos re-fortified the island on the orders of Alexios I Komnenos at the beginning of the 12th century, adding a supplementary castle on a small island. This castle was later called \"maidens castle\", because it was told that a king held his daughter here in captivity until she was killed by a venomous snake. It was prophesied she would die by a snake bite.  So she was taken to the sea castle to protect her, but a serpent was taken by basket to the castle, she was bitten and died. Corycus was conquered by the Armenians soon after it was rebuilt by the Byzantines.\nUntil the mid-14th century the Armenians held both the mainland and island castles, which guarded this strategic port for the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia. Simon, the Baron of Ko\u0155ikos, attended the coronation of King Levon I in 1198/99. Subsequent Armenian nobles maintained authority in the area (with a few brief interruptions) until 1360, when Peter I, the King of Cyprus, removed the Mamelukes and assumed suzerainty. In the late 14th century it fell again to the Turks. From 1448 or 1454 it belonged alternately to the Karamanids, the Egyptians, the Karamanids a second time, and finally to the Ottoman Empire.\nArchaeological surveys published in 1982 and 1987 found that the Armenians maintained (with occasional repairs) the mainland castle\u2019s simple Byzantine plan with its rectangular double walls, square towers, and two chapels, all of which were built with masonry taken from the nearby late antique city. The only original Armenian construction is one small chapel.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"last1\": \"Edwards\", \"first1\": \"Robert W.\", \"date\": \"1987\", \"title\": \"The Fortifications of Armenian Cilicia: Dumbarton Oaks Studies XXIII\", \"location\": \"Washington, D.C.\", \"publisher\": \"Dumbarton Oaks, Trustees for Harvard University\", \"isbn\": \"0-88402-163-7\"}[3] Kizkalesi (castle) on the island has the extensive remains of Armenian rebuilding. The island was once connected to the mainland fort by a breakwater.\nThe ruins of the city are extensive. Among them are a triumphal arch, a necropolis with a beautiful Christian tomb, sarcophagi, etc. The two medieval castles, one on the shore, the other in an islet, connected by a ruined pier, are partially preserved; the former was reputed impregnable. The walls of the castle on the mainland contain many pieces of columns; and a mole of great unhewn rocks projects from one angle of the fortress about a hundred yards across the bay. Three churches are also found, one decorated with frescoes. The walls of the ancient city may still be traced, and there appear to be sufficient remains to invite a careful examination of the spot.\n\nBishopric\nThe city figures in the Synecdemus of Hierocles, and in a Notitia Episcopatuum of about 840.[4] The bishopric of Corycus was a suffragan of Tarsus, the capital of the Roman province of Cilicia Prima, to which Corycus belonged. Of the bishops of the see, Germanus was at the First Council of Constantinople in 381; Sallustius took part in the Council of Ephesus in 431[5] and a synod held in Tarsus in 434, and was represented at the Council of Chalcedon by his metropolitan bishop Theodorus, who signed the acts of the council on his behalf; Archelaus went to a synod called by Patriarch Menas of Constantinople in 536; Cyprianus was at the Second Council of Constantinople in 553; and Ioannes participated in the Third Council of Constantinople in 680 and the Trullan Council in 692. In the aftermath of the Fourth Crusade, Corycus became the seat of Latin Church bishops, one of whom, named Gerardus, took part in a council at Antioch in 1136.[6][7][8][9] No longer a residential bishopric, Corycus is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.[10]\nTwo Armenian inscriptions that were discovered at the castles of Korykos were credited to its construction to Levon I and then to Hetum I.[11]\n\nCorycian Cave\nIn the Corycian Cave (now Cennet ve Cehennem), 20 stadia inland, says Strabo, the best crocus (saffron) grows. He describes this cave as a great hollow, of a circular form, surrounded by a margin of rock, on all sides of a considerable height; on descending into this cavity, the ground is found to be uneven and generally rocky, and it is filled with shrubs, both evergreen and cultivated; in some parts the saffron is cultivated: there is also a cave here which contains a large source, which pours forth a river of pure, pellucid water, but it immediately sinks into the earth, and flowing underground enters the sea: they call it the Bitter Water. Pomponius Mela (i.13) has a long description of the same place apparently from the same authority that Strabo followed, but more embellished. This place is probably on the top of the mountain above Corycus.\nThis place is famed in Greek mythology. It is the Cilician cave of Pindar (Pythian Ode i. 31), and of Aeschylus (Prom. Vinct. 350), and it is the lair of Zeus' fiercest opponent, the monster Typhon or Typhoeus.\n\nGallery\nLand castle of Korykos Southwest front\nLand castle of Korykos Southwest and southeast front\nLand castle of Korykos Southwest and southeast front\nLand castle of Korykos View from necropolis across the road\nLand castle of Korykos Northwest front\nLand castle of Korykos Northeast side\nLand castle of Korykos Channel along Northeast side\nLand castle of Korykos Spolia\nLand castle of Korykos View northeast with possible harbour entrance\nLand castle of Korykos Channel along Northeast side\nLand castle of Korykos Southeast side\nLand castle of Korykos Southeast front\nLand castle of Korykos Inside southeast walls\nLand castle of Korykos Interior looking northeast\nLand castle of Korykos Interior\nKorykon Soldier's grave\nKorykon Necropolis and castles\nKorykon Sarcophagus\nKorykon Sarcophagi and church\nKorykon Church\nKorykon Church\nKorykon Church\nKorykon Church\nKorykon Church\nKorykon Church\nKorykon Church\n",
