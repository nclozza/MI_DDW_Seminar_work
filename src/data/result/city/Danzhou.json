    "content": "Danzhou\n\nDanzhou (Chinese: \u510b\u5dde; pinyin: D\u0101nzh\u014du) is a prefecture-level city in the northwest of the Chinese island province of Hainan. Although called a \"city\", Danzhou administers a large area which was called Dan County or Danxian (\u510b\u53bf) until 1993. The administrative seat and urban center of Danzhou is Nada Town, which is often colloquially referred to as Danzhou city. Danzhou was upgraded from a county-level city into a prefecture-level city in February 2015.\n\nHistory\nWhat is now Danzhou was firstly named Danzhou (\u510b\u5dde) during the Song Dynasty in the 12th century and only renamed to Danxian in 1912 after hundreds of years, but later re-obtained its name Danzhou after the Communist takeover in the 1950s.\nDuring World War 2, Danzhou was among the top most devastated counties in Hainan as the Japanese had massacred more than 30,000 people in Danzhou, destroying over than 10,000 houses and 300 Danzhou villages.[2]\n\nSubdivisions\nDanzhou is a prefecture-level city of the Hainan province. An uncommon administrative feature is that it has no county-level division. The city government directly administers over 17 towns (\u9547; zh\u00e8n), one state-run institute, and four state-run farms plus an economic development zone:\n\nDemographics\nThe city's population was 932,362 in 2010. The Han population is 857,342 and the minority population is 75,020.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.danzhou.gov.cn/dzgov/zwgk/tjgb/201105/t20110530_536854.html\", \"language\": \"zh-hans\", \"scripttitle\": \"zh:\\u510b\\u5dde\\u5e02\\u7b2c\\u516d\\u6b21\\u4eba\\u53e3\\u666e\\u67e5\\u4e3b\\u8981\\u6570\\u636e\\u516c\\u62a5\", \"transtitle\": \"Danzhou Sixth Population Census Data Bulletin\", \"accessdate\": \"15 April 2014\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20130522052841/http://www.danzhou.gov.cn/dzgov/zwgk/tjgb/201105/t20110530_536854.html\", \"archivedate\": \"22 May 2013\"}\n\nLanguage\nThe Danzhou natives speak the Yue Danzhou dialect, unlike the Min Hainanese language that is spoken throughout most of eastern Hainan.\n\nTransportation\nThe area will be served by Danzhou Airport, an under-construction airport approximately 25\u00a0km (16\u00a0mi) northeast of Nada.[5] It will be international-class, built to handle the increasing number of tourists visiting the area. The airport is scheduled for completion in 2022.[6]{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.whatsonsanya.com/sanya-travel-2213.html\", \"title\": \"Archived copy\", \"accessdate\": \"29 December 2015\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20160215195650/http://www.whatsonsanya.com/sanya-travel-2213.html\", \"archivedate\": \"15 February 2016\"}{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.danzhou.gov.cn/dzgov/ywdt/jrdz/201212/t20121219_846954.html\", \"title\": \"\\u510b\\u5dde\\u673a\\u573a\\u9009\\u5740\\u521d\\u5b9a\\u6885\\u82b1\\u5cad \\u5f20\\u7426\\u4e25\\u671d\\u541b\\u51fa\\u5e2d\\u4f1a\\u8bae\\u5e76\\u8bb2\\u8bdd\", \"date\": \"19 December 2012\", \"publisher\": \"Danzhou Municipal People's Government, Hainan Province\", \"transtitle\": \"Zhangzhou Airport Site Selected at Zhangzhou Meihualing - Zhang Qi Yan Chaojun attended the meeting and delivered a speech\", \"accessdate\": \"21 July 2018\"}\nThe Hainan Western Ring High-Speed Railway also provides access.\n\nReferences\naDirect-administered Municipalities.\nbSub-provincial cities as provincial capitals.\ncSeparate state-planning cities.\n1Special economic-zone Cities.\n2Open Coastal Cities.\n3Prefecture capital status established by Heilongjiang Province and not recognized by Ministry of Civil Affairs.
