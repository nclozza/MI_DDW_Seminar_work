It was connected to Atil by a pontoon bridge.\nKhazaran was later inhabited primarily by Muslims and featured numerous mosques, minarets, and madrasas. It was a bustling trade center easily reachable by ship from the Caspian Sea and Volga River, and many of its inhabitants were crafters, fishers, and traders. The leader of the city was a Muslim official known as the Khazz; in Arab sources the title given is sometimes vizier.\n\n\n\n",
