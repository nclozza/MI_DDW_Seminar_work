The earliest known settlement in the vicinity was Tell Abu Hawam, a small port city established in the Late Bronze Age (14th century BCE).[6] In the 3rd century CE, Haifa was known as a dye-making center. Over the millennia, the Haifa area has changed hands: being conquered and ruled by the Canaanites, Israelites, Phoenicians, Persians, Hasmoneans, Romans, Byzantines, Arabs, Crusaders, Ottomans, and the British. Since the establishment of the Israeli state in 1948, the Haifa Municipality has governed the city.\nAs of 2016[update], the city is a major seaport located on Israel's Mediterranean coastline in the Bay of Haifa covering 63.7 square kilometres (24.6\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). It lies about 90 kilometres (56\u00a0mi) north of Tel Aviv and is the major regional center of northern Israel.

The British Survey of Western Palestine estimated Haifa's population to be about 3,000 in 1859.[45]\nThe arrival of German messianics, many of whom were Templers, in 1868, who settled in what is now known as the German Colony of Haifa, was a turning point in Haifa's development.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.tour-haifa.co.il/eng/modules/article/view.article.php/38/c2\", \"title\": \"Modern Haifa\", \"accessdate\": \"15 February 2008\"} The Templers built and operated a steam-based power station, opened factories and inaugurated carriage services to Acre, Nazareth and Tiberias, playing a key role in modernizing the city.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://schumacher.haifa.ac.il/templers.htm\", \"title\": \"Templers\", \"publisher\": \"[[University of Haifa]]\", \"accessdate\": \"27 January 2008\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20070701120321/http://schumacher.haifa.ac.il/templers.htm\"}\nThe first major wave of Jewish immigration to Haifa took place in the mid-19th century from Morocco, with a smaller wave of immigration from Turkey a few years later.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/36725\", \"last\": \"Gaon\", \"first\": \"Moshe David\"} In the 1870s, large numbers of Jewish and Arab migrants came to Haifa due to the town's growing prosperity. Jews constituted one-eighth of Haifa's population, almost all of whom were recent immigrants from Morocco and Turkey who lived in the Jewish Quarter, which was located in the eastern part of the town. Continued Jewish immigration gradually raised the Jewish population of Haifa, and included a small number of Ashkenazi families, most of whom opened hotels for Jewish migrants coming into the city. A wave of European Jews arrived at the end of the 19th century from Romania. The Central Jewish Colonisation Society in Romania purchased over 1,000 acres (4.0\u00a0km2) near Haifa. As the Jewish settlers had been city dwellers, they hired the former fellahin tenants to instruct them in agriculture.[48] The First Aliyah of the late 19th century and the Second Aliyah of the early 20th century saw Jewish immigrants, mainly from Eastern Europe, arrive in Haifa in significant numbers. The Jewish population rose from 1,500 in 1900 to 3,000 on the eve of World War I.[49]\nIn 1909, Haifa became important to the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith when the remains of the B\u00e1b, founder of the B\u00e1b\u00ed Faith and forerunner of Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h in the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith, were moved from Acre to Haifa and interred in the shrine built on Mount Carmel. Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds consider the shrine to be their second holiest place on Earth after the Shrine of Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h in Acre. Its precise location on Mount Carmel was shown by Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h himself to his eldest son, \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1, in 1891. \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 planned the structure, which was designed and completed several years later by his grandson, Shoghi Effendi. In a separate room, the remains of \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 were buried in November 1921.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"12 October 2003\", \"title\": \"Golden anniversary of the Queen of Carmel\", \"url\": \"http://news.bahai.org/story/252\", \"publisher\": \"Bah\\u00e1\\u02bc\\u00ed World News Service\"}\nIn the early 20th century, Haifa began to emerge as an industrial port city and growing population center. A branch of the Hejaz railway, known as the Jezreel Valley railway, was built between 1903 and 1905. The railway increased the city's volume of trade, and attracted workers and foreign merchants. In 1912, construction began on the Technion Institute of Technology, a Jewish technical school that was to later become one of Israel's top universities, although studies did not begin until 1924. The Jews of Haifa also founded numerous factories and cultural institutions.\n\nBritish Mandate\nHaifa was captured from the Ottomans in September 1918 by Indian horsemen of the British Army armed with spears and swords who overran Ottoman positions.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/on-haifa-day-india-salutes-wwi-troops-1.315380\", \"title\": \"On Haifa Day India salutes World War I troops\", \"last\": \"Eyadat\", \"first\": \"Fadi\", \"date\": \"24 September 2010\", \"work\": \"Haaretz\"} On 22 September, British troops were heading to Nazareth when a reconnaissance report was received indicating that the Turks were leaving Haifa.

The port was a major source of income, and the nearby towns of the Krayot were established in the 1930s. At the same time, the Arab population also swelled by an influx of migrants, coming mainly from surrounding villages as well as Syrian Hauran.[55] The Arab immigration mainly came as a result of prices and salary drop.[55] The 1922 census of Palestine, conducted by the British authorities, recorded Haifa as having a population of 9,377 Muslims, 8,863 Christians, 6,230 Jews, and 164 others. By the time of the 1931 census of Palestine, this had increased to 20,324 Muslims, 13,824 Christians, 15,923 Jews, and 332 others.[56][57] Between the censuses of 1922 and 1931, the Muslim, Jewish, and Christian populations rose by 217%, 256%, and 156%, respectively.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"1923\", \"title\": \"Palestine: Report and General Abstracts of the Census of 1922\", \"publisher\": \"Government of Palestine\", \"editor\": \"J. B. Barron\"} In 1938, 52,000 Jews and 51,000 Muslims and Christians lived in Haifa.[59]\nHaifa's development owed much to British plans to make it a central port and hub for Middle-East crude oil. The British Government of Palestine developed the port and built refineries, thereby facilitating the rapid development of the city as a center for the country's heavy industries. Haifa was also among the first towns to be fully electrified. The Palestine Electric Company inaugurated the Haifa Electrical Power Station already in 1925, opening the door to considerable industrialization.[60] The State-run Palestine Railways also built its main workshops in Haifa.\nBy 1945 the population was 33% Muslim, 20% Christian and 47% Jewish.[61]{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www1.haifa.muni.il/aliya/pages.aspx?pageName=History\", \"title\": \"Haifa Municipality \\u2013 Aliya Web Site\", \"publisher\": \".haifa.muni.il\", \"accessdate\": \"13 October 2013\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20131012143611/http://www1.haifa.muni.il/aliya/pages.aspx?pageName=History\", \"archivedate\": \"12 October 2013\"} In 1947, about 70,910 Arabs (41,000 Muslims and 29,910 Christians) and 74,230 Jews were living there.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"title\": \"Supplement to a Survey of Palestine\", \"url\": \"http://www.palestineremembered.com/Acre/Maps/Story574.html\"} The Christian community were mostly Greek-Melkite Catholics.\n\n1947\u20131948 Civil War in Palestine\nThe 1947 UN Partition Plan in late November 1947 designated Haifa as part of the proposed Jewish state. Arab protests over that decision evolved into violence between Jews and Arabs that left several dozen people dead during December.[64] The Arab city was in a state of chaos. The local Arab national committee tried to stabilize the situation by organizing garrison, calming the frightened residents and to stop the flight. In a public statement, the national committee called upon the Arab residents to obey orders, be alert, keep calm, and added: \"Keep away the cowards who wish to flee. Expell them from your lines. Despise them, because they harm more than the enemy\". Despite the efforts, Arab residents abandoned the streets which bordered Jewish neighborhoods and during the days of the general strike instigated by the Arab Higher Committee, some 250 Arab families abandoned the Khalisa neighborhood.[65]\nOn 30 December 1947, members of the Irgun, a Jewish underground militia, threw bombs into a crowd of Arabs outside the gates of the Consolidated Refineries in Haifa, killing six and injuring 42. In response Arab employees of the company killed 39 Jewish employees in what became known as the Haifa Oil Refinery massacre.[66] The Jewish Haganah militia retaliated with a raid on the Arab village of Balad al-Shaykh, where many of the Arab refinery workers lived, in what became known as the Balad al-Shaykh massacre.[67]\nBritish forces in Haifa redeployed on 21 April 1948, withdrawing from most of the city while still maintaining control over the port facilities. Two days later the downtown, controlled by a combination of local and foreign (ALA) Arab irregulars was assaulted by Jewish forces in Operation Bi'ur Hametz, by the Carmeli Brigade of the Haganah, commanded by Moshe Carmel.[citation needed] The operation led to a massive displacement of Haifa's Arab population. According to The Economist at the time, only 5,000\u20136,000 of the city's 62,000 Arabs remained there by 2 October 1948.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.mideastweb.org/refugees1.htm\", \"title\": \"The Palestine Refugee Problem\", \"publisher\": \"Mideastweb.org\"}\nContemporaneous sources emphasized the Jewish leadership's attempt to stop the Arab exodus from the city and the Arab leadership as a motivating factor in the refugees' flight. According to the British district superintendent of police, \"Every effort is being made by the Jews to persuade the Arab populace to stay and carry on with their normal lives, to get their shops and business open and to be assured that their lives and interests will be safe.\"[69] Time magazine wrote on 3 May 1948: \"The mass evacuation, prompted partly by fear, partly by orders of Arab leaders, left the Arab quarter of Haifa a ghost city. ... By withdrawing Arab workers their leaders hoped to paralyze Haifa.\"\nBenny Morris said Haifa's Arabs left due to a combination of Zionist threats and encouragement to do so by Arab leaders. Ilan Papp\u00e9 writes that the shelling culminated in an attack on a Palestinian crowd in the old marketplace using three-inch (76\u00a0mm) mortars on 22 April 1948.[70][71][72] Shabtai Levy, the Mayor of the city, and some other Jewish leaders urged Arabs not to leave. According to Ilan Papp\u00e9, Jewish loudspeakers could be heard in the city ordering Arab residents to leave \"before it's too late.\"[73]\nMorris quotes British sources as stating that during the battles between 22 and 23 April 100 Arabs were killed and 100 wounded, but he adds that the total may have been higher.[74]\n\nState of Israel\nAfter the Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel on 14 May 1948 Haifa became the gateway for Jewish immigration into Israel. During the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War, the neighborhoods of Haifa were sometimes contested. After the war, Jewish immigrants were settled in new neighborhoods, among them Kiryat Hayim, Ramot Remez, Ramat Shaul, Kiryat Sprinzak, and Kiryat Eliezer. Bnei Zion Hospital (formerly Rothschild Hospital) and the Central Synagogue in Hadar Hacarmel date from this period. In 1953, a master plan was created for transportation and the future architectural layout.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.tour-haifa.co.il/eng/modules/article/view.article.php/36/c2\", \"title\": \"History since Independence\", \"accessdate\": \"9 April 2008\"} In 1959, a group of Sephardi and Mizrahi Jews, mostly Moroccan Jews, rioted in Wadi Salib, claiming the state was discriminating against them.[76] Their demand for \"bread and work\" was directed at the state institutions and what they viewed as an Ashkenazi elite in the Labor Party and the Histadrut.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://usa.mediamonitors.net/headlines/sifting_through_the_ruins_historic_wadi_salib_under_pressure\", \"title\": \"Sifting Through the Ruins: Historic Wadi Salib Under Pressure.\", \"last\": \"Johal\", \"first\": \"Am\", \"date\": \"18 August 2004\", \"publisher\": \"Media Monitors Network\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20070928015832/http://usa.mediamonitors.net/headlines/sifting_through_the_ruins_historic_wadi_salib_under_pressure\", \"archivedate\": \"28 September 2007\"}\nTel Aviv gained in status, while Haifa suffered a decline in the role as regional capital. The opening of Ashdod as a port exacerbated this. Tourism shrank when the Israeli Ministry of Tourism placed emphasis on developing Tiberias as a tourist centre.[78] Nevertheless, Haifa's population had reached 200,000 by the early 1970s, and mass immigration from the former Soviet Union boosted the population by a further 35,000.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.tour-haifa.co.il/eng/modules/article/view.article.php/38/c2\", \"title\": \"Modern Haifa\", \"accessdate\": \"15 February 2008\"} Many of Wadi Salib's historic Ottoman buildings have now been demolished, and in the 1990s a major section of the Old City was razed to make way for a new municipal center.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.tour-haifa.co.il/eng/modules/article/view.article.php/38/c2\", \"title\": \"Modern Haifa\", \"accessdate\": \"15 February 2008\"}{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://usa.mediamonitors.net/headlines/sifting_through_the_ruins_historic_wadi_salib_under_pressure\", \"title\": \"Sifting Through the Ruins: Historic Wadi Salib Under Pressure.\", \"last\": \"Johal\", \"first\": \"Am\", \"date\": \"18 August 2004\", \"publisher\": \"Media Monitors Network\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20070928015832/http://usa.mediamonitors.net/headlines/sifting_through_the_ruins_historic_wadi_salib_under_pressure\", \"archivedate\": \"28 September 2007\"}\nFrom 1999 to 2003, several Palestinian suicide attacks took place in Haifa (in Maxim and Matza restaurants, bus 37, and others), killing 68 civilians.

For the most part these valleys are undeveloped natural corridors that run up through the city from the coast to the top of the mountain. Marked hiking paths traverse these areas and they provide habitat for wildlife such as wild boar, golden jackal, hyrax, Egyptian mongoose, owls and chameleons.\n\nClimate\nHaifa has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate with hot, dry summers and mild, rainy winters (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Csa).[95] Spring arrives in March when temperatures begin to increase. By late May, the temperature has warmed up considerably to herald warm summer days. The average temperature in summer is 26\u00a0\u00b0C (79\u00a0\u00b0F) and in winter, 12\u00a0\u00b0C (54\u00a0\u00b0F). Snow is rare in Haifa, but temperatures around 3\u00a0\u00b0C (37\u00a0\u00b0F) can sometimes occur, usually in the early morning. Humidity tends to be high all year round, and rain usually occurs between September and May. Annual precipitation is approximately 629 millimeters (25\u00a0in).\n\nNeighborhoods\nHaifa has developed in tiers, from the lower to the upper city on the Carmel. The oldest neighborhood in modern Haifa is Wadi Salib, the Old City center near the port, which has been bisected by a major road and razed in part to make way for government buildings. Wadi Salib stretches across to Wadi Nisnas, the center of Arab life in Haifa today. In the 19th century, under Ottoman rule, the German Colony was built, providing the first model of urban planning in Haifa. Some of the buildings have been restored and the colony has turned into a center of Haifa nightlife.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.tourism.gov.il/Tourism_Euk/Destinations/Haifa/general+info.htm\", \"title\": \"Haifa \\u2013 General info\", \"accessdate\": \"20 March 2008\"}\nThe first buildings in Hadar were constructed at the start of the 20th century. Hadar was Haifa's cultural center and marketplace throughout the 1920s and into the 1980s, nestled above and around Haifa's Arab neighborhoods. Today Hadar stretches from the port area near the bay, approximately halfway up Mount Carmel, around the German Colony, Wadi Nisnas and Wadi Salib.[99] Hadar houses two commercial centers (one in the port area, and one midway up the mountain) surrounded by some of the city's older neighborhoods.\nNeve Sha'anan, a neighborhood located on the second tier of Mount Carmel, was founded in the 1920s. West of the port are the neighborhoods of Bat Galim, Shikmona Beach, and Kiryat Eliezer. To the west and east of Hadar are the Arab neighborhoods of Abbas and Khalisa, built in the 1960s and 70s.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.goisrael.com/Tourism_Euk/Tourist+Information/Discover+Israel/Cities/Haifa.htm\", \"title\": \"Haifa\", \"publisher\": \"Israel Government Tourism Ministry\", \"accessdate\": \"21 March 2008\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20090108130722/http://www.goisrael.com/Tourism_Euk/Tourist+Information/Discover+Israel/Cities/Haifa.htm\", \"archivedate\": \"8 January 2009\"} To the south of Mount Carmel's headland, along the road to Tel Aviv, are the neighborhoods of Ein HaYam, Shaar HaAliya, Kiryat Sprinzak and Neve David.\nAbove Hadar are affluent neighborhoods such as the Carmel Tzarfati (French Carmel), Merkaz HaCarmel, Romema, Ahuzat Ha'Carmel (Ahuza), Carmeliya, Vardiya, Ramat Golda, Ramat Alon and Hod Ha'Carmel (Denya).
