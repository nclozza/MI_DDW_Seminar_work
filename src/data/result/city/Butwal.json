It lies in Province No. 5, Rupandehi District and also the interim capital of province 5 of Nepal. It was given the title \u201cGreen City of Nepal 2019\u201d. It is also home to the administrative headquarters of Lumbini Zone. This city stands beside the bank of Tilottama River (Tinau River, and at the northern edge of the Terai plain below the Siwalik Hills. Its name, Butwal was derived from Batauli Bazaar, the town's oldest residential area which is located on the western bank of Tinau river. Butwal is a lively city comprising the Panoramic views of the combination of hills and plains.\nGeographically, Butwal is at the intersection of Nepal's two different National Highways, Mahendra Highway and Siddhartha Highway. It connects western Nepal with the capital Kathmandu through highway and air links (via airport at Siddharthanagar).

Thus, historically Butwal connected Nepali people with their Indian neighbors. As the British East India Company annexed Awadh from its hereditary rulers while the Shah Dynasty attempted to annex the Terai, Butwal became one of bones of contention leading to the Gurkha War 1814-16.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"last \": \"Handa\", \"first \": \"O.C.\", \"title \": \"History of Uttaranchal\", \"place \": \"New Delhi\", \"publisher \": \"Indus Publishing Co.\", \"year \": \"2002\"}{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"editorlast \": \"Saugat\", \"editorfirst \": \"Om\", \"title \": \"Encyclopedic History of Indian Freedom Movement\", \"chapter \": \"Chapter 10: Relations with Nepal and Burma\", \"place \": \"New Delhi\", \"publisher \": \"saugat\", \"year \": \"2003\", \"accessdate \": \"April 13, 2011\", \"pages \": \"280\\u2013282\"}\nWhen King Tribhuvan fled to India in 1950 during the revolt against the Rana dynasty he travelled through Butwal.
