It lies in Province No. 5, Rupandehi District and also the interim capital of province 5 of Nepal. It was given the title \u201cGreen City of Nepal 2019\u201d. It is also home to the administrative headquarters of Lumbini Zone. This city stands beside the bank of Tilottama River (Tinau River, and at the northern edge of the Terai plain below the Siwalik Hills. Its name, Butwal was derived from Batauli Bazaar, the town's oldest residential area which is located on the western bank of Tinau river. Butwal is a lively city comprising the Panoramic views of the combination of hills and plains.\nGeographically, Butwal is at the intersection of Nepal's two different National Highways, Mahendra Highway and Siddhartha Highway. It connects western Nepal with the capital Kathmandu through highway and air links (via airport at Siddharthanagar). It is one of the fastest-growing cities in Nepal for education, infrastructure, highway, marketing, health and safety, communication, trade and banking sectors. It has highway connections to the Indian border at Sunauli and to the hilly towns in Tansen and Pokhara valley, and holds the title of being \"The Best City in Nepal\" five times in a row.\nNotable areas within Butwal includes:\nButwal was officially declared as sub-metropolitan city on 2 December 2014 by combining two neighbouring VDCs Motipur and Semlar.\n\nPrehistory\nFossils of ancient hominoids Ramapithecus were found near the Tinau (Tilottama) River as early as 1932, including a 10.1-million-year-old tooth.[2]\n\nModern history\nThe area was a loose settlement which acted as a trading post between the hilly districts of Lumbini zone and the Indian plains. Thus, historically Butwal connected Nepali people with their Indian neighbors. As the British East India Company annexed Awadh from its hereditary rulers while the Shah Dynasty attempted to annex the Terai, Butwal became one of bones of contention leading to the Gurkha War 1814-16.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"last \": \"Handa\", \"first \": \"O.C.\", \"title \": \"History of Uttaranchal\", \"place \": \"New Delhi\", \"publisher \": \"Indus Publishing Co.\", \"year \": \"2002\"}{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"editorlast \": \"Saugat\", \"editorfirst \": \"Om\", \"title \": \"Encyclopedic History of Indian Freedom Movement\", \"chapter \": \"Chapter 10: Relations with Nepal and Burma\", \"place \": \"New Delhi\", \"publisher \": \"saugat\", \"year \": \"2003\", \"accessdate \": \"April 13, 2011\", \"pages \": \"280\\u2013282\"}\nWhen King Tribhuvan fled to India in 1950 during the revolt against the Rana dynasty he travelled through Butwal. Then it was little more than a village on the western bank of Tilottama River (also known as Tinau).\nButwal is a relatively newly urbanized area, emerging and growing rapidly only since 1960. With the completion of Siddhartha Highway in 1968, starting from the border at Sunauli through Butwal to Pokhara and then in the 1990s Mahendra Highway across the full east\u2013west expanse of Nepal's Terai; i.e. Mechi Zone in the east to Mahakali Zone in the West, Butwal have made a tremendous progress in the country.\n\nDemographics\nThe population of Butwal is 91,733 (census 2015), according to present stage the population is rapidly increasing with around 150,000 above and consists of people of mixed groups and castes; these includes Pahari immigrants from nearby hill districts especially Palpa, Arghakhanchi, Parbat, Gulmi, Syangja and  also local people from Terai origin.l[5]\nThe population distribution in different wards in 2011 was as follows:{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.butwalmun.org.np/page-Statistical_reports\", \"title\": \"Butwal Nagarpalika\", \"website\": \"www.butwalmun.org.np\", \"accessdate\": \"20 October 2014\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20150608221618/http://www.butwalmun.org.np/page-Statistical_reports\", \"last1\": \"Butwal\", \"first1\": \"Municipality\"}\nThe majority of the population is Hindu.
