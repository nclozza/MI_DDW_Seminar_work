Since annexing Crimea in 2014, the Russian Federation has administered Sevastopol as a federal city. Nevertheless, Ukraine and most of the UN member countries continue to regard Sevastopol as a city with special status within Ukraine. The population is made up of mostly Russians with small numbers of Ukrainians and Tatars.\nSevastopol has a population of 393,304\u00a0(2014 Census),[3] concentrated mostly near the Sevastopol Bay and surrounding areas. The location and navigability of the city's harbours have made Sevastopol a strategically important port and naval base throughout history. The city has been a home to the Russian Black Sea Fleet, which is why it was considered as a separate city in Crimea of significant military importance and was once operated by the Soviet Union as a closed city.\nAlthough relatively small at 864 square kilometres (334\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), Sevastopol's unique naval and maritime features have been the basis for a robust economy. The city enjoys mild winters and moderate warm summers, characteristics that help make it a popular seaside resort and tourist destination, mainly for visitors from the former Soviet republics. The city is also an important centre for marine biology research. In particular, dolphins have been studied and trained in the city by the military since the end of World War II.\n\nEtymology\nThe name of Sevastopolis was originally chosen in the same etymological trend as other cities in the Crimean peninsula; it was intended to express its ancient Greek origins. It is a compound of the Greek adjective, \u03c3\u03b5\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2 (sebastos, 'venerable') and the noun \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2 (p\u00f3lis) ('city'). \u03a3\u03b5\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2 is the traditional Greek equivalent (Sebastian) of the Roman honorific Augustus, originally given to the first emperor of the Roman Empire, Augustus and later awarded as a title to his successors.\nDespite its Greek origin, the name is not from Ancient Greek times. The city was probably named after Empress (\"Augusta\") Catherine II of the Russian Empire who founded Sevastopol in 1783. She visited the city in 1787, accompanied by Joseph II, the Emperor of Austria, and other foreign dignitaries.\nIn the west of the city, there are well-preserved ruins of the ancient Greek port city of Chersonesos, founded in the 5th[citation needed] (or 4th) century BC by settlers from Heraclea Pontica. This name means \"peninsula\", reflecting its immediate location. It is not related to the ancient Greek name for the Crimean Peninsula as a whole: Cherson\u0113sos Taurik\u0113 (\"the Taurian Peninsula\").\nThe name of the city is spelled as:\n\nHistory\nChersonesus founded in 6th century BC\nHellenic Colonies 6th century BC \u2013 480 BC\nBosporan Kingdom 480 BC \u2013 107 BC\nKingdom of Pontus 107 BC \u2013 63 BC\nRoman Republic 63 BC\u201327 BC\nRoman Empire 27 BC \u2013 330\nByzantine Empire 330\u20131204\nEmpire of Trebizond 1204\u20131461\nPrincipality of Theodoro 1461\u20131475\nCrimean Khanate 1475\u20131783 (Ottoman vassal from 1478 to 1774)\nRussian Empire 1783\u20131917\nFounded as Sevastopol in 1783\nRussian Republic 1917\nRussian SFSR (Soviet Union) 1917\u20131942\nNazi Germany 1942\u20131944\nRussian SFSR (Soviet Union) 1944\u20131954\nUkrainian SSR (Soviet Union) 1954\u20131991\nUkraine 1991\u20132014 (de jure \u2013 present)\nRussian Federation 2014\u2013present\nIn the 6th century BC, a Greek colony was established in the area of the modern-day city. The Greek city of Chersonesus existed for almost two thousand years, first as an independent democracy and later as part of the Bosporan Kingdom. In the 13th and 14th centuries, it was sacked by the Golden Horde several times and was finally totally abandoned. The modern day city of Sevastopol has no connection to the ancient and medieval Greek city, but the ruins are a popular tourist attraction located on the outskirts of the city.\n\nPart of the Russian Empire\nSevastopol was founded in June 1783 as a base for a naval squadron under the name Akhtiar[8] (White Cliff),[9] by Rear Admiral Thomas MacKenzie (Foma Fomich Makenzi), a native Scot in Russian service; soon after Russia annexed the Crimean Khanate. Five years earlier, Alexander Suvorov ordered that earthworks be erected along the harbour and Russian troops be placed there. In February 1784, Catherine the Great ordered Grigory Potemkin to build a fortress there and call it Sevastopol. The realisation of the initial building plans fell to Captain Fyodor Ushakov who in 1788 was named commander of the port and of the Black Sea squadron.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.sevastopol.info/history/hist_first.htm\", \"title\": \"\\u041e\\u0441\\u043d\\u043e\\u0432\\u0430\\u043d\\u0438\\u0435 \\u0438 \\u0440\\u0430\\u0437\\u0432\\u0438\\u0442\\u0438\\u0435 \\u0421\\u0435\\u0432\\u0430\\u0441\\u0442\\u043e\\u043f\\u043e\\u043b\\u044f (Osnovaniye i razvitiye Sevastopolya)\", \"date\": \"28 May 2007\", \"language\": \"Russian\", \"transtitle\": \"Foundation and development of Sevastopol\", \"accessdate\": \"26 April 2010\", \"publisher \": \"Sevastopol.info\"} It became an important naval base and later a commercial seaport. In 1797, under an edict issued by Emperor Paul I, the military stronghold was again renamed to Akhtiar. Finally, on 29 April (10 May), 1826, the Senate returned the city's name to Sevastopol.\nOne of the most notable events involving the city is the Siege of Sevastopol (1854\u201355) carried out by the British, French, Piedmontese, and Turkish troops during the Crimean War, which lasted for 11 months. Despite its efforts, the Russian army had to leave its stronghold and evacuate over a pontoon bridge to the north shore of the inlet. The Russians chose to sink their entire fleet to prevent it from falling into the hands of the enemy and at the same time to block the entrance of the Western ships into the inlet. When the enemy troops entered Sevastopol, they were faced with the ruins of a formerly glorious city.[citation needed]\nA panorama of the siege originally was created by Franz Roubaud. After its destruction in 1942 during World War II, it was restored and is currently housed in a specially constructed circular building in the city. It portrays the situation at the height of the siege, on 18 June 1855.[citation needed]\n\nWorld War II\nDuring World War II, Sevastopol withstood intensive bombardment by the Germans in 1941\u201342, supported by their Italian and Romanian allies during the Battle of Sevastopol. German forces used railway artillery\u2014including history's largest-ever calibre railway artillery piece in battle, the 80-cm calibre Schwerer Gustav\u2014and specialised mobile heavy mortars to destroy Sevastopol's extremely heavy fortifications, such as the Maxim Gorky Fortresses. After fierce fighting, which lasted for 250 days, the supposedly untakable[citation needed] fortress city finally fell to Axis forces in July 1942. It was intended to be renamed to \"Theoderichshafen\" (in reference to Theoderic the Great and the fact that the Crimea had been home to Germanic Goths until the 18th or 19th century) in the event of a German victory against the Soviet Union, and like the rest of the Crimea was designated for future colonisation by the Third Reich. It was liberated by the Red Army on 9 May 1944 and was awarded the Hero City title a year later.\n\nSevastopol as part of Ukrainian SSR\nDuring the Soviet era, Sevastopol became a so-called \"closed city\". This meant that any non-residents had to apply to the authorities for a temporary permit to visit the city.\nOn 29 October 1948, the Presidium of Supreme Council of the Russian SFSR issued a ukase (order) which confirmed the special status of the city.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://ukrlife.org/main/uacrim/obermif34.htm\", \"title\": \"\\u0423\\u043a\\u0440\\u0430\\u0457\\u043d\\u0441\\u044c\\u043a\\u0435 \\u0436\\u0438\\u0442\\u0442\\u044f \\u0432 \\u0421\\u0435\\u0432\\u0430\\u0441\\u0442\\u043e\\u043f\\u043e\\u043bi \\u041c\\u0438\\u0445\\u0430\\u0439\\u043b\\u043e \\u041b\\u0423\\u041a\\u0406\\u041d\\u042e\\u041a \\u041e\\u0411\\u0415\\u0420\\u0415\\u0416\\u041d\\u041e: \\u041c\\u0406\\u0424\\u0418! \\u041c\\u0456\\u0444 \\u043f\\u0440\\u043e \\u044e\\u0440\\u0438\\u0434\\u0438\\u0447\\u043d\\u0443 \\u043d\\u0430\\u043b\\u0435\\u0436\\u043d\\u0456\\u0441\\u0442\\u044c \\u0421\\u0435\\u0432\\u0430\\u0441\\u0442\\u043e\\u043f\\u043e\\u043b\\u044f \\u0420\\u043e\\u0441\\u0456\\u0457\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20141208165334/http://ukrlife.org/main/uacrim/obermif34.htm\", \"archivedate\": \"8 December 2014\", \"work\": \"archive.org\"} Soviet academic publications since 1954, including the Great Soviet Encyclopedia, indicated that Sevastopol, Crimean Oblast was part of the Ukrainian SSR (Great Soviet Encyclopedia 1976, Vol.23. pp 104).{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://slovari.yandex.ru/~%D0%BA%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B3%D0%B8/%D0%91%D0%A1%D0%AD/%D0%A1%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8C/\", \"title\": \"\\u042f\\u043d\\u0434\\u0435\\u043a\\u0441.\\u0421\\u043b\\u043e\\u0432\\u0430\\u0440\\u0438\", \"accessdate\": \"3 May 2014\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20140817005956/http://slovari.yandex.ru/~%D0%BA%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B3%D0%B8/%D0%91%D0%A1%D0%AD/%D0%A1%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8C/\", \"archivedate\": \"17 August 2014\", \"work\": \"yandex.ru\", \"df\": \"dmy-all\"}\nIn 1954, under Nikita Khrushchev, both Sevastopol and the remainder of the Crimean peninsula were administratively transferred from being territories within the Russian SFSR to being territories administered by the Ukrainian SSR.

A week later, the Russian deputy, Valentin Agafonov, stated that Russia was ready to supervise the referendum on Crimean independence and include the republic as a separate entity in the CIS. On 28 July 1993, one of the leaders of the Russian Society of Crimea, Viktor Prusakov, stated that his organisation was ready for an armed mutiny and establishment of the Russian administration in Sevastopol.\nIn September, the commander of the joint Russian-Ukrainian Black Sea Fleet, Eduard Baltin\u00a0[ru], accused Ukraine of converting some of his fleet and conducting an armed assault on his personnel, and threatened to take countermeasures of placing the fleet on alert. (In June 1992, the Russian president Boris Yeltsin and the Ukrainian president Leonid Kravchuk had agreed to divide the former-Soviet Black Sea Fleet between Russia and Ukraine.  Eduard Baltin had been appointed commander of the Black Sea Fleet by Yeltsin and Kravchuk on 15 January 1993.)\nIn May 1997, Russia and Ukraine signed the Peace and Friendship Treaty, ruling out Moscow's territorial claims to Ukraine.[17] A separate agreement established the terms of a long-term lease of land, facilities, and resources in Sevastopol and the Crimea by Russia.[citation needed]\nThe ex-Soviet Black Sea Fleet and its facilities were divided between Russia's Black Sea Fleet and the Ukrainian Naval Forces. The two navies co-used some of the city's harbours and piers, while others were demilitarised or used by either country. Sevastopol remained the location of the Russian Black Sea Fleet headquarters with the Ukrainian Naval Forces Headquarters also in the city. A judicial row periodically continued over the naval hydrographic infrastructure both in Sevastopol and on the Crimean coast (especially lighthouses historically maintained by the Soviet or Russian Navy and also used for civil navigation support).\nAs in the rest of the Crimea, Russian remained the predominant language of the city, although following the independence of Ukraine there were some attempts at Ukrainisation with very little success. The Russian society in general and even some outspoken government representatives never accepted the loss of Sevastopol and tended to regard it as temporarily separated from the homeland.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://ua.pravda.com.ua/news/2007/2/21/54793.htm\", \"title\": \"\\u041b\\u0443\\u0436\\u043a\\u043e\\u0432 \\u0437\\u043d\\u0430\\u0439\\u0448\\u043e\\u0432 \\u0443 \\u0441\\u0435\\u0440\\u0446\\u0456 \\u0440\\u0430\\u043d\\u0443 \\u0456 \\u0445\\u043e\\u0447\\u0435 \\u043f\\u043e\\u0447\\u0443\\u0432\\u0430\\u0442\\u0438 \\u0441\\u0435\\u0431\\u0435 \\u0432 \\u041a\\u0440\\u0438\\u043c\\u0443 \\u044f\\u043a \\u0432\\u0434\\u043e\\u043c\\u0430\", \"work\": \"pravda.com.ua\"}\nIn July 2009, the chairman of the Sevastopol city council, Valeriy Saratov (Party of Regions)[19] stated that Ukraine should increase the amount of compensation it is paying to the city of Sevastopol for hosting the foreign Russian Black Sea Fleet, instead of requesting such obligations from the Russian government and the Russian Ministry of Defense in particular.[20]\nOn 27 April 2010, Russia and Ukraine ratified the Russian Ukrainian Naval Base for Gas treaty, extending the Russian Navy's lease of Crimean facilities for 25 years after 2017 (through 2042) with an option to prolong the lease in 5-year extensions. The ratification process in the Ukrainian parliament encountered stiff opposition and erupted into a brawl in the parliament chamber.

The city is designated a special city-region of Ukraine which besides the city itself includes several of its outlying settlements. The city itself is concentrated mostly at the western portion of the region and around the long Bay of Sevastopol. This bay is a ria, a river canyon drowned by Holocene sea-level rise, and the outlet of Chorna River. Away in a remote location southeast of Sevastopol is located the former city of Balaklava (since 1957 incorporated within Sevastopol), the bay of which in Soviet times served as a main port for the Soviet diesel-powered submarines.\nThe coastline of the region is mostly rocky, in a series of smaller bays, a great number of which are located within the Bay of Sevastopol. The biggest of them are the Southern Bay (within Bay of Sevastopol), the Archer Bay, a gulf complex that consists of the Deergrass Bay, the Bay of Cossack, the Salty Bay, and many others. There are over thirty bays in the immediate region.\nThrough the region flow three rivers: the Belbek, Chorna, and Kacha. All three mountain chains of Crimean mountains are represented in Sevastopol, the southern chain by the Balaklava Highlands, the inner chain by the Mekenziev Mountains, and the outer chain by the Kara-Tau Upland (Black Mountain).\n\nClimate\nSevastopol has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Cfa),{\"citetype\": \"journal\", \"year\": \"2006\", \"title\": \"World Map of the K\\u00f6ppen-Geiger climate classification updated\", \"url\": \"http://www.schweizerbart.de/resources/downloads/paper_free/55034.pdf\", \"journal\": \"Meteorol.

However, during the 2014 Crimean crisis, the pro-Russian City Council threw its support behind Russian citizen Alexei Chaly as the \"people's mayor\" and said it would not recognise orders from Kiev.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"25 February 2014\", \"title\": \"Ukraine: Sevastopol installs pro-Russian mayor as separatism fears grow\", \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/25/ukraine-sevastopol-installs-pro-russian-mayor\", \"agency\": \"The Guardian\", \"accessdate\": \"29 March 2014\"}{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"2 March 2014\", \"title\": \"Sevastopol City Council refuses to recognize Kyiv leadership\", \"url\": \"http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/sevastopol-city-council-refuses-to-recognize-kyiv-leadership-338124.html\", \"agency\": \"Kyiv Post\", \"accessdate\": \"29 March 2014\"}\nAfter the Accession of Crimea to the Russian Federation, the Legislative Assembly of Sevastopol replaced the City Council and the mayor is appointed by the legislative branch on the nomination of the Russian President,[29] and officially the mayor is called the Governor of Sevastopol City.\n\nAdministrative and municipal divisions\nSevastopol is administratively divided into four districts.\nWithin the Russian municipal framework, the territory of the federal city of Sevastopol is divided into nine municipal okrugs and the Town of Inkerman. While individual municipal divisions are contained within the borders of the administrative districts, they are not otherwise related to the administrative districts.\n\nEconomy\nApart from navy-related civil facilities, Sevastopol hosts some other notable industries.  An example is Stroitel,[30]  one of the leading plastic manufacturers in Russia.\nThe city received millions of US Dollars in compensation for hosting the Russian Black Sea Fleet from the Russian and the Ukrainian government.\n\nInfrastructure\nThere are seven types of transport in Sevastopol:\nSevastopol Shipyard comprises three facilities that together repair, modernise, and re-equip Russian Naval ships and submarines.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://fas.org/nuke/guide/russia/industry/sevmorverf.htm\", \"title\": \"Sevmorverf (Sevastopol Shipyard)\", \"date\": \"24 August 2000\", \"publisher\": \"Federation of American Scientists\", \"accessdate \": \"8 July 2013\"} The Sevastopol International Airport is used as a military aerodrome at the moment and being reconstructed to be used by international airlines.\nSevastopol maintains a large port facility in the Bay of Sevastopol and in smaller bays around the Heracles peninsula. The port handles traffic from passengers (local transportation and cruise), cargo, and commercial fishing. The port infrastructure is fully integrated with the city of Sevastopol and naval bases of the Black Sea Fleet.\n\nTourism\nAfter World War II, Sevastopol was entirely rebuilt. Many top architects and civil engineers from Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev and other cities and thousands of workers from all parts of the USSR took part in the rebuilding process which was mostly finished by the mid-1950s. The downtown core situated on a peninsula between two narrow inlets, South Bay and Artillery Bay, features mostly Mediterranean-style, three-story residential buildings with columned balconies and Venetian-style arches, with retail and commercial spaces occupying the ground level. Some carefully restored landmarks date back to the early 20th century (e.g., the Art Nouveau Main Post Office on Bolshaya Morskaya St and the Art Museum on Nakhimovsky Prospect). It has been a long-time tradition for the residents of surrounding suburbs to spend summer evenings by coming to the downtown area for a leisurely stroll with their families along the avenues and boulevards encircling the Central Hill, under the Sevastopol chestnut trees, and usually ending up on the waterfront with its Marine Boulevard.[citation needed]\nDue to its military history, most streets in the city are named after Russian and Soviet military heroes. There are hundreds of monuments and plaques in various parts of Sevastopol commemorating its military past.\nAttractions include:\nSevastopol Artillery Bay view.\nThe seaside of Sevastopol.\nSt. Vladimir's Cathedral at 'the city hill'.\nSaints Peter and Paul Cathedral.\nView of the Northern side.\nOld city cemetery.\nMain railway station.\nThe Panorama Museum (The Heroic Defence of Sevastopol during the Crimean War).\nThe Storming of Sapun-gora of 7 May 1944, the Diorama Museum (World War II).\nEntrance to Balaklava bay, 2010.\n\n\nDemographics\nThe population of Sevastopol proper is 443,211 (01.01.19),[32] making it the largest in the Crimean Peninsula. The city's agglomeration has about 600,000 people (2015).

The Western districts have modern architecture. More recently, numerous skyscrapers have been built. Balaklava Bayfront Plaza (on hold), currently under construction, will be one of the tallest buildings in Ukraine, at 173\u00a0m (568\u00a0ft) with 43 floors.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/?buildingID=82259\", \"title\": \"Balaklava Bayfront Plaza, Sevastopol\", \"publisher\": \"SkyscraperPage.com\", \"accessdate\": \"26 April 2010\"}\nAfter the 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea the city's monument to Petro Konashevych-Sahaidachny was removed and handed over to Kharkiv.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.sq.com.ua/rus/news/obschestvo/23.08.2014/v_harkove_poyavitsya_pamyatnik_sagajdachnomu/\", \"title\": \"\\u0412 \\u0425\\u0430\\u0440\\u044c\\u043a\\u043e\\u0432\\u0435 \\u043f\\u043e\\u044f\\u0432\\u0438\\u0442\\u0441\\u044f \\u043f\\u0430\\u043c\\u044f\\u0442\\u043d\\u0438\\u043a \\u0421\\u0430\\u0433\\u0430\\u0439\\u0434\\u0430\\u0447\\u043d\\u043e\\u043c\\u0443\", \"work\": \"Status Quo\"}\n\nGallery\nView of Sevastopol\nShips of the Black Sea Fleet docked in Sevastopol\nNakhimov Square\nPalace of Culture\nLunacharsky Theater\nArtillery Bay\n",
