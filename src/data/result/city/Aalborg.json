With a population of 217,075 (as of 2019[update]), the Municipality of Aalborg is the third most populous in the country after Copenhagen and Aarhus.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.statbank.dk/BY1\", \"title\": \"BY1: Population 1.

The distance to Copenhagen is 412 kilometres (256\u00a0mi) if travelling by road and not using ferries.\nThe earliest settlements date to around AD\u00a0700. Aalborg's position at the narrowest point on the Limfjord made it an important harbour during the Middle Ages, and later a large industrial centre. Architecturally, the city is known for its half-timbered mansions built by its prosperous merchants. Budolfi Church, now a cathedral, dates from the end of the 14th century and Aalborghus Castle, a royal residence, was built in 1550. Today, Aalborg is a city in transition from a working-class industrial area to a knowledge-based community. A major exporter of grain, cement, and spirits, its thriving business interests include Siemens Wind Power, Aalborg Industries, and Aalborg Portland. These companies have become global producers of wind turbine rotors, marine boilers and cement.\nWith its theatres, symphony orchestra, opera company, performance venues, and museums such as Aalborg Historical Museum and the Aalborg Museum of Modern Art, Aalborg is an important cultural hub. The Aalborg Carnival, held at the end of May, is one of the largest festivals in Scandinavia, attracting some 100,000+ people annually. The major university is the University of Aalborg, founded in 1974, which has more than 20,000 students (as of 2018).[8] The University College of Northern Denmark is one of seven new regional organisations while the Royal School of Library and Information Science (RSLIS) provides higher education in library and information science. Tr\u00e6nregimentet, the Danish regiment for army supply and emergency medical personnel, is also in Aalborg. Aalborg University Hospital, the largest in the north of Jutland, was founded in 1881.\nThe football club Aalborg BK, established in 1885 and based at Nordjyske Arena, won the Danish Superliga in the 1994\u201395 season, the 1998\u201399 season, the 2007\u201308 season and the 2013\u201314 season. Other sports associations include the icehockey club Aalborg Pirates, the men's handball team Aalborg H\u00e5ndbold, the rugby club Aalborg RK, and Aalborg Cricket Club. Aalborg Railway Station, on John F. Kennedys Plads has connected the city to Randers and the south since 1869. Aalborg Airport is just 6 kilometres (3.7\u00a0mi) northwest of the city centre, and the E45, a European route from Alta, Norway, to Gela, Italy, passes through Aalborg.\nThe European Commission has concluded that the citizens of Aalborg are the most satisfied people in Europe with their city.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.eu-norddanmark.dk/dk/nyheder/aalborg_er_eus_mest_tilfredse_by.htm\", \"title\": \"Archived copy\", \"accessdate\": \"2014-03-07\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20140308003643/http://www.eu-norddanmark.dk/dk/nyheder/aalborg_er_eus_mest_tilfredse_by.htm\", \"archivedate\": \"2014-03-08\"}\n\nHistory\nThe area around the narrowest point on the Limfjord  attracted settlements as far back as the Iron Age leading to a thriving Viking community until around the year 1000 in what has now become Aalborg. In the Middle Ages, royal trading privileges, a natural harbour and a thriving herring fishing industry contributed to the town's growth. Despite the difficulties it experienced over the centuries, the city began to prosper once again towards the end of the 19th century when a bridge was built over Limfjord and the railway arrived. Aalborg's initial growth relied on heavy industry but its current development focuses on culture and education.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.en.ses.aau.dk/Admission/New+Student+Service/The+History+of+Aalborg/\", \"title\": \"The History of Aalborg\", \"publisher\": \"Aalborg University\", \"accessdate\": \"20 August 2013\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20140201210950/http://www.en.ses.aau.dk/Admission/New+Student+Service/The+History+of+Aalborg/\", \"archivedate\": \"1 February 2014\"}\n\nBeginnings\nAalborg traces its history back over a thousand years. It was originally settled as a trading post because of its position on the Limfjord. The sites of what were two settlements and a burial ground can be seen on Lindholm H\u00f8je, a hill overlooking the city. These large settlements, one from the 6th-century Germanic Iron Age, the other from the Viking Age in the 9th to 11th centuries,{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"1986\", \"title\": \"Nordjylland\", \"url\": \"https://books.google.com/books?id=erh0NwAACAAJ\", \"publisher\": \"Gyldendal\", \"page\": \"158\", \"isbn\": \"978-87-00-80962-8\", \"accessdate\": \"20 August 2013\", \"author\": \"Hans Lyngby Jepsen\"} evolved at the narrowest point on Limfjord as a result of the traffic between Himmerland to the south and Vendsyssel to the north.\nThe first mention of Aalborg under its original name Alabu or Alabur is found on coins from c.\u00a01040, the period when King Harthacnut (Hardeknud) settled in the area. In c.\u00a01075, Adam of Bremen reported that Alaburg, as he called it in German, was an important harbour for ships sailing to Norway.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"2000\", \"title\": \"Danmarks k\\u00f8bst\\u00e6der: 144 k\\u00f8bst\\u00e6der og andre gamle byer\", \"url\": \"https://books.google.com/books?id=sFX8OwAACAAJ\", \"publisher\": \"Politiken\", \"pages\": \"50\\u201354\", \"isbn\": \"978-87-567-6203-8\", \"accessdate\": \"20 August 2013\", \"author1\": \"S\\u00f8ren Olsen\", \"author2\": \"Kasper Monty\"} In Valdemar's Danish Census Book from 1231 it was called Aleburgh, possibly meaning \"the fort by the stream\" as  in Old Norse all meant a stream or current and bur or burgh a fort or a castle.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.alabur.dk/Om_Alabur.htm\", \"title\": \"Alaburs historie\", \"publisher\": \"Alabur.dk\", \"language\": \"Danish\", \"accessdate\": \"24 August 2013\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20110903144833/http://www.alabur.dk/Om_Alabur.htm\", \"archivedate\": \"3 September 2011\"}\nThe Church of Our Lady in Aalborg was originally built in the early 12th century but was demolished during the Reformation.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.en.ses.aau.dk/Admission/New+Student+Service/The+History+of+Aalborg/\", \"title\": \"The History of Aalborg\", \"publisher\": \"Aalborg University School of Engineering and Science\", \"accessdate\": \"5 September 2013\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20140201210950/http://www.en.ses.aau.dk/Admission/New+Student+Service/The+History+of+Aalborg/\", \"archivedate\": \"1 February 2014\"}  Grey Friar Convent, on the east side of \u00d8ster\u00e5, was probably built around 1240; it was documented in 1268 when it was a Franciscan Convent of the Order of Friars Minor, but like many other Roman Catholic monasteries and convents was shut down in 1530 as a result of the Reformation.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.en.ses.aau.dk/Admission/New+Student+Service/The+History+of+Aalborg/\", \"title\": \"The History of Aalborg\", \"publisher\": \"Aalborg University School of Engineering and Science\", \"accessdate\": \"5 September 2013\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20140201210950/http://www.en.ses.aau.dk/Admission/New+Student+Service/The+History+of+Aalborg/\", \"archivedate\": \"1 February 2014\"}\n\nMiddle Ages\nAalborg's earliest trading privileges date from 1342, when King Valdemar IV received the town as part of his huge dowry on marrying Helvig of Schleswig. The privileges were extended by Eric of Pomerania in 1430 and by Christopher of Bavaria in 1441. The town prospered, becoming one of the largest communities in Denmark.

For over 300 years, it has housed the city's oldest pharmacy.[89]\nJ\u00f8rgen Olufsen's House (J\u00f8rgen Olufsens G\u00e5rd) on \u00d8ster\u00e5gade is Denmark's best preserved merchant's mansion in the Renaissance style. Built mainly of sandstone in 1616, it also has a half-timbered section. The style is reminiscent of similar buildings in the north of Germany and in the Netherlands. Olufsen, Jens Bang's half brother, was not only a successful merchant but also mayor of Aalborg. When it was built, the residence with its integrated warehouse was on the \u00d8ster\u00e5, an inlet from the sound with access for barges. The old iron bar with a hook for scales can be seen in the portico.[90][91]\nAalborghus Castle (Aalborghus Slot) is a half-timbered building with red-painted woodwork and whitewashed wall panels.

It is now used as a centre for arts and crafts.[95] Finally, the headquarters of Danish Distillers (De Danske Spritfabrikker), to the west of the Limfjord Bridge, is noted for its Neoclassical appearance. Completed in 1931 by the architect Alf Cock-Clausen, it combines functionality with decorative classical symbolism. Considered a masterpiece of Danish factory design, it is now a Danish National Heritage site.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"1986\", \"title\": \"Nordjylland\", \"url\": \"https://books.google.com/books?id=erh0NwAACAAJ\", \"publisher\": \"Gyldendal\", \"page\": \"158\", \"isbn\": \"978-87-00-80962-8\", \"accessdate\": \"20 August 2013\", \"author\": \"Hans Lyngby Jepsen\"}[96] When the factory closed in 2014, was the area bought by an investor, who will use the buildings to create an international culture city with museums, theatres, apartments etc.\n\nOther landmarks\nJomfru Ane Gade (literally Virgin Anne's Street) is one of the most famous streets in Aalborg if not in Denmark. Popular for its caf\u00e9s and restaurants during the day, it is even busier at night with its clubs, discos and bars. During the 1990s, the street was infamously a 'hang out' of two biker gangs who were at war for some years all over Scandinavia. As the bikers disappeared it became increasingly popular for people of all ages.[97][97] The pedestrian hubs of Nytorv Square and John F. Kennedy Square in the central city area are also part of the cityscape.\nAalborgt\u00e5rnet is a tripod tower erected in 1933 with a restaurant on the top. The tower itself is 55\u00a0m (180\u00a0ft) high; but as it stands on the top of the Skovbakken hill, it reaches a total height of 105\u00a0m (344.49\u00a0ft) above sea level, providing a view over the sound and the city. Designed by Carlo Odg\u00e5rd, it was erected in 1933 in connection with the North Jutland Fair.[98]\nIn 2008, the Utzon Center, its art, architecture and design credited to the noted architect J\u00f8rn Utzon, is also dedicated to him.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://denmark.dk/en/quick-facts/map-of-denmark/aalborg/\", \"title\": \"Aalborg \\u2013 a city of taste\", \"publisher\": \"Official Website of Denmark\", \"accessdate\": \"2 September 2013\"} It was built next to the Limfjord at the central harbour front in Aalborg. Born in Copenhagen, Utzon grew up in Aalborg. The centre contains an exhibition on Utzon's work, which includes the Sydney Opera House, as well as educational displays on architecture and design.[99] The centre consists of several individual buildings creating a special place around a courtyard on a platform. The tall sculptural roofs of the auditorium and the boat-hall, both on the harbour front, and the library facing the park area and the city are set off by the lower roofs of the exhibition and workshop areas inside the complex.[100]\n\nCulture\nThe annual Aalborg Carnival usually takes place in the last weekend of May.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.karnevaliaalborg.dk/\", \"title\": \"Tak til Kong Karneval\", \"publisher\": \"Aalborg Carnival\", \"language\": \"Danish\", \"accessdate\": \"17 August 2013\"} It consists of three events: the children's carnival (B\u00f8rnekarneval),{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://aalborgkarneval.dk/program/bornekarneval/?lang=en\", \"title\": \"The Children's Carnival\", \"publisher\": \"Aalborg Carnival\", \"accessdate\": \"22 August 2013\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20130610131059/http://aalborgkarneval.dk/program/bornekarneval/?lang=en\", \"archivedate\": \"10 June 2013\"} the battle of carnival bands,{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://aalborgkarneval.dk/program/battle-of-carnival-bands-2/?lang=en\", \"title\": \"Battle of the Carnival Bands\", \"publisher\": \"Aalborg Carnival\", \"accessdate\": \"22 August 2013\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20130610234952/http://aalborgkarneval.dk/program/battle-of-carnival-bands-2/?lang=en\", \"archivedate\": \"10 June 2013\"} and the carnival proper. Attracting about 100,000 visitors, it is the biggest carnival in Scandinavia and one of the largest in northern Europe.[42] Hjallerup Market in Hjallerup, about 20 kilometres (12\u00a0mi) northeast of Aalborg is one of the oldest and largest markets in Denmark and is the largest horse market in Europe.[80] Held for three days in the beginning of June, it annually attracts more than 200,000 people and 1200 horses.[80]\nIn 1999 Aalborg was for the first time one of the four host ports in The Tall Ships Race (then Cutty Sark Tall Ships Race) of that year. The city hosted the world's largest event for sailing vessels again in 2004 and 2010, and will do so for the fourth time in less than two decades when The Tall Ships Races visits Aalborg in early August 2015.\n\nMajor venues\nAalborgs Kongres & Kultur Center, designed in a functional style by Otto Frankild, was completed in 1952. The centre's main component, the Aalborg Hall, can be divided into sections. The complex also contains a hotel, restaurant, bowling alley, and a number of meeting rooms. The smaller Europahallen was added in 1991, making the centre the largest in Scandinavia.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.arkark.dk/building.aspx?buildingid=1736\", \"title\": \"Aalborg-hallen, Aalborg Kongres- og Kulturcenter\", \"language\": \"Danish\", \"accessdate\": \"24 August 2013\"} With over 100 theatrical and musical presentations per year, it offers international stars, opera, ballet, musicals, classical concerts, productions for children as well as pop and rock concerts.

Aalborg is the seat of a bishop within the Lutheran State Church of Denmark. The cathedral of this bishopric is the Budolfi Church, originally built no later than 1132 by Viborg's Bishop Eskil. This church was considerably smaller than the current one, as it was merely a parish church. The existing structure was completed in the late 14th century, on the grounds of the former church, and was listed for the first time in the Atlas of Denmark in 1399. The church was named after St Botolph, an English abbot and saint.[126] The church is constructed in the Gothic style.[126] In 1554 Aalborg was made a diocese and, after consideration, St Budolfi Church was made the seat of the Bishop of Aalborg. Aalborg is also home to the former Catholic church, the Abbey of Our Lady, converted from a Benedictine nunnery.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.vorfruekirke.dk\", \"title\": \"Abbey of Our Lady\", \"publisher\": \"Vorfruekirke\", \"accessdate\": \"19 August 2013\"}\n\nChurches\nThe present Budolfi Church, which has the status of a cathedral, dates from the end of the 14th century, although at least two earlier churches stood on the same spot.

After the original tower was destroyed by fire in 1663, the striking new Baroque tower, based on that of an earlier Copenhagen city hall, was completed in 1779. The church has 16th-century frescoes and an intricately carved early Baroque altarpiece from 1689 created by Lauridtz Jensen.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.aalborgdomkirke.dk/ny.aspx\", \"title\": \"Alborg Domkirke - Budolfi Kirke\", \"publisher\": \"Aalborg Domkirke\", \"language\": \"Danish\", \"accessdate\": \"23 August 2013\", \"author\": \"Niels Clemmensen\"}\nAbbey of Our Lady (Vor Frue Kirke) was designed in 1878 by J.E.

Sankt J\u00f8rgens Kirkeg\u00e5rd (St George's Cemetery) was on the corner of Hasserisgade and Kirkeg\u00e5rdsgade. The site was chosen in a district outside the city as it provided isolation for those affected by the plague, many of whom died in the neighbouring hospice, Sankt J\u00f8rgens G\u00e5rde. In 1794, a new cemetery was opened in Klostermarken, immediately to the south of Sankt J\u00f8rgens Kirkeg\u00e5rd. It was further extended in 1804, 1820 and 1870.
