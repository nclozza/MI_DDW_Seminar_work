The city is located in the center of Macedonia between Mount Paiko and the plain of Giannitsa, and is the economic, commercial and industrial center of the Pella regional unit. European route E86 (Greek National Road 2) runs along the south of the city.\nThe former shallow, swampy, and variable-sized Giannitsa Lake or (ancient) Loudias Lake, fed by the Loudias River and south of the city, was drained in 1928-1932 by the New York Foundation Company..[4] It or the surrounding marshland were sometimes called Borboros 'slime' or Borboros Limen.[5]\nAbout 7\u00a0km (4\u00a0mi) from Giannitsa are the ruins of ancient Pella, birthplace of Alexander the Great and capital of ancient Macedonia. The city is 48\u00a0km (30\u00a0mi) from Thessaloniki.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.macedonia.info/pellis.htm\", \"title\": \"Macedonia - Perfecture of Pella\", \"accessdate\": \"13 January 2016\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20160304223433/http://www.macedonia.info/pellis.htm\", \"archivedate\": \"4 March 2016\"}\n\nName\nThe city was founded as  Yenice-i Vardar Ottoman Turkish \u064a\u06ad\u064a\u062c\u06c0 \u0648\u0627\u0631\u062f\u0627\u0631 'new (town) of Vardar' in around 1372.

Giannitsa was also inhabited through the Bronze and Iron Ages. Incidental findings, such as coins, inscriptions, and sculptures indicate that the area was inhabited during the Hellenistic period (323-30BC). In ancient times, the area was called Bottiaea.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.hellinon.net/NeesSelides/GianitsaNeolithika.htm\", \"title\": \"\\u039f \\u039d\\u0395\\u039f\\u039b\\u0399\\u0398\\u0399\\u039a\\u039f\\u03a3 \\u039f\\u0399\\u039a\\u0399\\u03a3\\u039c\\u039f\\u03a3 \\u03a4\\u03a9\\u039d \\u0393\\u0399\\u0391\\u039d\\u039d\\u0399\\u03a4\\u03a3\\u03a9\\u039d\"}\n\nOttoman\nThough there was probably a pre-existing Byzantine castle in the vicinity, the importance of the city of Yenije begins with its foundation by Gazi Evrenos in around 1372. Yenije became the base of the ghazi followers of Evrenos who took Macedonia and later Albania. The city was an important Ottoman cultural center and sacred area in the 15th and 16th centuries. Starting in the mid-15th century, Yenice became a center of literature and the arts. Under Ahmet Bey, a descendant of Gazi Evrenos, many mosques, schools, workhouses and charitable projects were founded.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.pellanet.gr/index.php?com=page&item=20\", \"title\": \"\\u0399\\u03c3\\u03c4\\u03bf\\u03c1\\u03af\\u03b1 \\u0393\\u03b9\\u03b1\\u03bd\\u03bd\\u03b9\\u03c4\\u03c3\\u03ce\\u03bd\", \"work\": \"PellaNet Online\"}\nIn the early 20th century, Yenije was a battleground between Bulgarian and Greek-Macedonian partisans in the Macedonian struggle. Penelope Delta's novel Secrets of the Swamp (referring to the shores of Giannitsa Lake) is a romanticised account of this from the Greek point of view.[citation needed]\n\nBalkan wars\nYenice \"retained its emphatically Turkish character up to 1912\" and members of the Evrenos family lived in the city in a large palace in the center of town until then.[12] In the First Balkan War, the Battle of Yenice  (20 October 1912) was one of the most important battles the Greek army fought.\n\nGerman occupation\nThe German army invaded Giannitsa on April 11, 1941 . On April 20, 1941, some Austrian forces arrived. The municipal registry of Giannitsa confirms four random killings in various parts of the city. On 16 September 1943, the Municipality of Giannitsa, headed by the Mayor, Thomas Magriotis and the help of local soccer teams organized a demonstration in the city and indulge[clarification needed] in German commandant a text against the intention of the Germans to surrender Central Macedonia to the Bulgarians. According to oral testimony on November 13, 1943, the Germans arrested around 50 people, whom they transferred to the camp of Pavlos Melas at Thessaloniki and they killed thirteen. At the same time, the Germans invaded for the first time the village Eleftherohori 7\u00a0km (4\u00a0mi) away from the city, steal and destroy. In this attack there were no casualties. On 23 March 1944, the village was burned, and the place deserted. Eleftherohori lost 19 lives. On 5 August 1944, the Austrian soldier Otmar Dorne left the German occupation army and joined the 30th Constitution of the E.L.A.S, based in Mount Paiko. The defection of Dorne, and the presence of the SS sergeant Schubert, led to mass reprisals on 14 September 1944 in Giannitsa: about 120 residents of Giannitsa were executed by forces of the Jagdkommando Schubert with the collaboration of Greek units under the command of G. Poulos. Among those executed was the Mayor, Thomas Mangriotis. The Swedish ambassador Timberg indicated that one third of the city was destroyed by fire. The citizens left the city. Emile Wenger visited Giannitsa few days after the mass execution, as a representative of the International Red Cross and wrote \"Giannitsa is already a dead city\". On 20 September 1944, a citizens' committee sent a message to the National Government stating the facts and asking for weapons. The Germans left Giannitsa on November 3, 1944.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.24grammata.com/?p=4216\", \"title\": \"24grammata.com Culture e-Magazine \\u2013 Free eBooks \\u2013 WebRadio  \\u00bb \\u03a4\\u03b1 \\u0393\\u03b9\\u03b1\\u03bd\\u03bd\\u03b9\\u03c4\\u03c3\\u03ac \\u03c3\\u03c4\\u03b1 \\u03c7\\u03c1\\u03cc\\u03bd\\u03b9\\u03b1 \\u03c4\\u03b7\\u03c2 \\u03ba\\u03b1\\u03c4\\u03bf\\u03c7\\u03ae\\u03c2 / E\\u03bb\\u03b5\\u03c5\\u03b8\\u03b5\\u03c1\\u03bf\\u03c7\\u03ce\\u03c1\\u03b9, 23 \\u039c\\u03b1\\u03c1\\u03c4\\u03af\\u03bf\\u03c5 1944\"}\n\nMonuments\nYenice was an important center in the Ottoman period, and several important monuments survive, such as the Tombs of Gazi Evrenos (built in 1417) and Gazi Ahmed Bey, the Kaifoun Baths, the Great Mosque, the Army Mosque, the hammam of Evrenos, and the Clock Tower, built from 1667 to 1668 by the Ottomans. (The choice of location was made with military criteria because they wanted to control the commercial activity that took place across the city and throughout central Macedonia.) These monuments have been declared historical monuments by the Greek Archaeological Service.[12]\nPoints of interest include also the Cathedral Church of Giannitsa (achieved in 1860), the Neoclassical Multicenter, the Filippeio tourist center, the Macedonian tombs, and the prehistoric settlement of Archontiko.\n\nAravyssos\nAbout 10\u00a0km (6\u00a0mi) northwest of the city is the spring of Aravyssos, which produces drinking water. The surrounding grove and creek include a popular park.\n\nEconomy\nGiannitsa is predominantly a rural area. The draining of the Lake Giannits\u00e0 left fertile soil for agriculture, leading to population growth in the region.\n\nEntertainment\nThe focus of the social life of the city is at the central pedestrian street, where people gather to eat and drink or to take a walk. Giannitsa was one of the first cities that founded Open Theatre (3000\u00a0seats) and became an institution for cultural events and big names in theater and music, every year, the last month of summer giving a culture festival character . Also various theatrical and musical events take place in a closed theater located internally of the Cultural Centre which has a modern architecture. In the first days of September there is a big market for about a week. The DI.\u00a0K.\u00a0E.\u00a0P.\u00a0A.\u00a0P.

The Nautical Club of Giannitsa (NOG) teaches canoeing, kayaking, and rowing.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.freewebs.com/nog-1/history.htm\", \"title\": \"Archived copy\", \"accessdate\": \"2014-03-24\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20140324185113/http://www.freewebs.com/nog-1/history.htm\"}\n\nSports\nThe most popular team is the Anagennisi Giannitsa football team which plays at the Municipal Stadium.\nThere is a motocross track northwest of the city, in the foothills of Mount Paiko, where local, Greek, and European races are run.\nAt the river Loudias, there are rowing races in which the Nautical Club participates.\n\nTwin towns and sister cities\nGiannitsa is twinned with three cities:\n"}
