It is the easternmost county-level division of Zhenjiang City.\n\nHistory\nThere were only several smaller shoals in the area of present-day Yangzhong during the Eastern Jin. As time went on, they enlarged and merged into an elongated shoal by Tang dynasty, which was called Xiaozhou (\u5c0f\u6d32; literally: \"Small shoal\") in Song dynasty. It was renamed Xinzhou (\u65b0\u6d32) and then Ximinzhou (\u7d30\u6c11\u6d32) during Ming dynasty, and was designated Taipingzhou (\u592a\u5e73\u6d32) in Qing dynasty.\nIn 1904, the imperial court decided to establish a subprefecture named after Taiping. In 1911, it was promoted to a county. Since there is a namesake in Anhui. The county was renamed Yangzhong, the abbreviation of \"\u63da\u5b50\u6c5f\u4e2d\" which means \"(the shoal is) in the Yangtze River\".\n",
