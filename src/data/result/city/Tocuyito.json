This city is considered the entry point to Valencia from the motorways that lead to the Southwest (Barquisimeto) and South (towards Cojedes).\n\nGeography\nTocuyito is located in the flatlands of Carabobo, at an altitude of 451 metres above sea level. Its annual temperature is around 26\u00b0C.\n\nHistory\nTocuyito was founded in 1547 by Spanish Conquistador Juan de Villegas. The name derives from its initial similarity to the town of El Tocuyo (Tocuyito is little Tocuyo). Tocuyo is an Indian word for \"maniok juice\". \nThere was an important battle in Tocuyito on 14 September 1899, when the so-called Revolution for Liberal Restoration, led by Cipriano Castro, decisively defeated the governmental forces of president Ignacio Andrade.\n\nExternal links\nCoordinates: 10\u00b006\u203252\u2033N 68\u00b003\u203256\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff10.11444\u00b0N 68.06556\u00b0W\ufeff / 10.11444; -68.06556\n",
