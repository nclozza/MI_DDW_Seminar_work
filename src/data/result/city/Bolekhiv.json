It was once home to a large Jewish community, very few of whom survived World War II. Administratively, Bolekhiv is incorporated as a city of regional significance. Population: 21,610\u2009(2016 est.)[1].\n\nHistory\nBolekhiv is first mentioned in historical records in 1371 after the defeat of the Kingdom of Galicia\u2013Volhynia to Poland. During the Galicia\u2013Volhynia Wars in the 14th century, Bolekhiv was variously held by Poland, Hungary (Danylo Dazhbohovych), and Lithuania. Subsequently, King Jogaila of Poland succeeded and Bolekhiv became part of the Kingdom of Poland.\nIn 1546, Emilia Hrosovska established a salt refinery in the town. In 1603, Sigismund III Vasa gave the town the Magdeburg rights. At that time, the Bolekhiv region was involved with the Opryshky movement led by Oleksa Dovbush and German colonists arrived.\nAfter World War II, Bolekhiv became a raion (a region of local governance). In 1964, its raion was merged with Dolyna Raion. Since 1993 the city has been governed by the Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast.\n\nBolekhiv Jews\nA Jewish community existed in Bolekhiv (Yiddish pronunciation: Bolechov) since its establishment by Nicholas Gydzincki. The town founder proclaimed equal rights to the three ethnic groups living there, Jews, Polish Catholics and Ruthenians (Ukrainians of the Greek Orthodox), and this was confirmed by Sigismund III Vasa, the king of the new Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, formerly crown prince of Poland, the grand duke of Lithuania, and later to become king of Sweden.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"last1\": \"Weiner\", \"first1\": \"Miriam\", \"last2\": \"Ukrainian State Archives (in cooperation with)\", \"date\": \"1999\", \"chapter\": \"Chapter 11: Town Clips: Bolekhov\", \"title\": \"Jewish Roots in Ukraine and Moldova: Pages from the Past and Archival Inventories\", \"url\": \"http://www.rtrfoundation.org/webart/BOLEKHOV.pdf\", \"location\": \"Secaucus, NJ\", \"publisher\": \"Miriam Weiner Routes to Roots Foundation\", \"isbn\": \"978-0-9656508-1-6\", \"oclc\": \"607423469\", \"last3\": \"Moldovan National Archives (in cooperation with)\"}\nThe town was a privately owned town, and the changes of ownership or inheritance had a strong impact on all the residents of the town, especially the Jews. In 1670, after the Tatars invaded and burnt the town down, the town owner gave the Jews a large loan to rebuild. Towards the middle of the 19th century there was much tension between the Jews and the other ethnicities.[3]\nA Hassidic rebbe, Rabbi Shneibalg, \"the Rebbe of Bolechov\", had a large Hassidic court in the town.[4]\nBy 1890, seventy-five percent of the population of Bolekhiv (4,237 people) was Jewish.[5]\nAtrocities began in 1935, by a hostile government and population, and escalated after the German conquest in 1941.\nBy 1940 the Jewish population of Bolekhiv reached about 3,000.[6]\nOn 28 and 29 October 1941, four months after capturing the town, the German police carried out a first Aktion (German annihilation operation) in Bolekhiv, which included a list of 1,000 of the Jewish rabbis, leaders, doctors and richer people, who were tortured for two days, and then shot in a nearby forest, some buried alive.[7]\nIn 1941 and 1942 thousands of Jews were added to the population, from the surrounding towns.[6]\nAbout a year later, 3 to 5 September 1942, the Germans planned a second Aktion. The Jews were warned in advance by a member of their Judenrat who was in a nearby town, but many of the local Ukrainians began a murder spree in the preceding afternoon, targeting mainly children, in horrific acts of barbarity. The Germans joined in the action, and continued to grab people from their houses or hiding places.\nAbout 1,500 Jews were murdered, 600-700 of them children, and an additional 2,000 Jews were sent to the Belzec death camp where most were subsequently murdered.\nOther Aktions continued into 1943 when the surviving 900 Jews, working in makeshift \"work groups\", were marched to the cemetery nearby, in groups of 100 or 200, and shot.\nOnly 48 Jews of the town survived World War II[5]\n\nGeography\nThe Bolekhiv municipality is located in the western part of Ukraine in Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast. It shares borders with Dolyna Raion (east), Lviv Oblast (north, southwest and west), Zhydachiv Raion, Stryi Raion, and Skole Raion. Two rivers, the Sukil and the Svicha, run through the town before joining the Dniester. The Carpathian Mountains lie to the southwest. Bolekhiv is on Ukraine highway 10 between Dolyna and Stryi. The capital, Kiev is approximately 300\u00a0km away in a west northwesterly direction.[8]\n\nAdministrative divisions\nOn 21 October 1993, Bolekhiv received the status of a regional city (up until then, it had been a city in Dolyna Raion). It encompasses six rural municipalities (communes) and eleven villages.\nThe communes are:\n\nPopulation\nIn 2001, Bolekhiv city's population was 21,232. The largest districts in Bolekhiv are Bolekhiv city (10,590), Tysiv commune (3,352) and Mizhrichchia commune (1,891). The smallest community is the Huziiv commune with a population of 1,159 (2001).[9][10]\n",
