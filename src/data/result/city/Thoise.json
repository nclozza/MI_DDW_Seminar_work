The airstrip is a critical facility enabling a quick inflow of men and material from the Indian interior to Siachen, a glacier, helipad and battleground near the Actual Ground Position Line between India and Pakistan.\nTHOISE is not a real name but an acronym: Transit Halt Of Indian Soldiers Enroute (to Siachen).{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.bbc.co.uk/hindi/specials/2055_siachen/page5.shtml\"}  Thoise is about an hour and 20 minutes' flight from Delhi. Air India has limited flight operations from \"Thoise\" to Delhi (Flight AI 3832). Jet Airways operated flights to THOISE until decision was made to curtail operations due financial non viability towards the end of January 2019. With less than 12 qualified commercial pilots world over, this is an extremely tricky airfield to operate into. Special background clearance and multiple stringent  skill tests must  be passed by the pilots in order to be able to operate to THOISE. \nThe place is approximately 16 km away from the village of Hundar and 25 km from Diskit. It is about 160 km from Leh, the capital of Ladakh. Thoise is reached via the Khardung La mountain pass, one of the world's highest roads used by motor vehicles.\nThoise is out of bounds for civilians. The last checkpost is at Hundar, at a bridge where photography is not permitted. Indian Oil Corporation Limited is building an oil depot to serve the Indian Army. The construction project is in progress and is monitored from Chandigarh.\n"}
