It is located on the bank of the Chenab river, bounded by Faisalabad, Jhang, and Chiniot, three other cities in Punjab.\n\nHistory\nBhawana is one of the ancient cities of Pakistan. The Mughal Emperor Zahir-ud-din Babur also mentions the area in his book the Tuzk-e-Babari[citation needed] for its fine architecture and finely handcrafted jharoka windows of many of the old havelis (manors) and other buildings of the old/medieval town.\n\nGeography and climate\nBhawana is located by the side of Jhang Chiniot road and on the left bank of the Chenab river.[1] Recently, with a  budget of 250 million rupees, a bridge from Bhawana to Kalri has been constructed over the Chenab river. Leaders of opposition political parties specially Imran Khan and Billawal Bhutto have criticised the Chief Minister Punjab Shabaz Sharif for spending such a huge amount on a bridge to benefit CM' owned Ramzan Sugar Mills.[citation needed] Its soil is very fertile and is among the largest agricultural areas,[clarification needed] and the city itself also depends considerably on agriculture to bolster its economy. It is situated 37\u00a0km from Chiniot, 50\u00a0km from Faisalabad, 48\u00a0km from Jhang and 70\u00a0km from Sargodha. Its weather is much like the rest of Pakistan's, with summer, spring, winter and autumn seasons.[2] Its temperatures are usually moderate.[3]\n\nExternal links\n\n",
