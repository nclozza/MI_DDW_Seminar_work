The southern end of the Isinnitum Canal was joined back into the Euphrates at Kisurra.[1] The city lasted as a center for commerce and transport through the  Akkadian and part of the Babylonian Empires, until cuneiform texts and excavation show a decline during the time of Hammurabi (c.1800 BCE).[2]\n\nArchaeology\nGerman archaeologists, beginning with Robert Koldewey in 1902, have found many cuneiform tablets from Tell Abu Hatab.[3][4][5]\n\nExternal links\nCoordinates: 31\u00b050\u203217\u2033N 45\u00b028\u203250\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff31.83806\u00b0N 45.48056\u00b0E\ufeff / 31.83806; 45.48056\n",
