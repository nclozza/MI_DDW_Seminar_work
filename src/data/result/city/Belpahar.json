The plain stone fine surface is about 400 metre long and 250 metre wide.  On the eastern side of the fort there are almost 7\u00a0km of densely forested Baramunda Hills and on the western side, the Belpahar Railway Station is located at a distance of 5\u00a0km. On the north there is a dense forest stretching up to Hemgir and in the south stretching up to Badjob village.\nA 12\u00a0ft (3.66\u00a0m) wide and 500\u00a0ft (150\u00a0m) long moat had been constructed which stretches from east to west.  There was a Sivalingam and a place of worship in the Fort.  A well had been dug on the stone floor which provided drinking water to the inmates of the Fort throughout the year.\nOn the stone floor, there are many square holes and 70 round holes.  The diameters of the hole vary from 1-3 inch. Wooden poles used to be put on these holes to support super structures for living room, store room, arsenals, Kitchen, sleeping room etc.\nAbout 1000 people could take shelter at Ulapgarh at a time. On the western side of Ulapgarh and down hill there is Ushakothi cave.  On the walls and floors of this cave also there are many circular and square holes.  Probably the defence personnel of the fort used to suspend there clothes and other belonging from wooden poles fitted to these holes.  The soldiers of the dense forest of Maheswar hill could easily over power and defeat the enemies before they could climb up the hill and attack the fort.\nIt is believed that Ulapgarh was being used as a residential fort by some kings of \"Naja\" Dynasty. Research is going on by various Indian and Foreign researchers and Historian in this direction.\n",
