The city was built on Mount Mithridat, a hill on the western side of the Cimmerian Bosporus. It was founded by Milesians in the late 7th or early 6th century BC. The ruins of the site are now located in the modern city Kerch.\n\nEarly existence\nDuring the first centuries of the city's existence, imported Greek articles predominated: pottery (see Kerch Style), terracottas, and metal objects, probably from workshops in Rhodes, Corinth, Samos, and Athens. Local production, imitated from the models, was carried on at the same time. Athens manufactured a special type of bowl for the city, known as Kerch ware. Local potters imitated the Hellenistic bowls known as the Gnathia style as well as relief wares\u2014Megarian bowls. The city minted silver coins from the 5th century BC and gold and bronze coins from the 4th century BC.{\"citetype\": \"journal\", \"year\": \"1973\", \"title\": \"The Origins of the Greek Colony at Panticapaeum\", \"journal\": \"American Journal of Archaeology\", \"volume\": \"77\", \"issue\": \"1\", \"pages\": \"77\\u201381\", \"doi\": \"10.2307/503240\", \"jstor\": \"503240\", \"last\": \"Noonan\", \"first\": \"Thomas S.\", \"authorlink\": \"Thomas S.

Its economic decline in the 4th\u20133rd centuries BC was the result of the Sarmatian conquest of the steppes and the growing competition of Egyptian grain.\n\nMithridates\nThe last of the Spartocids, Paerisades V, apparently left his realm to Mithridates VI Eupator, king of Pontus. This transition was arranged by one of Mithridates's generals, Diophantus, who earlier had been sent to Taurica to help local Greek cities against Palacus of Lesser Scythia. The mission did not go smoothly: Paerisades was murdered by Scythians led by Saumacus, and Diophantus escaped to return later with reinforcements to suppress the revolt (c. 110\u00a0BC).\nHalf of a century later, Mithridates took his life in Panticapaeum, when, after his defeat in a war against Rome, his son and heir Pharnaces and citizens of Panticapaeum turned against him.\n",
