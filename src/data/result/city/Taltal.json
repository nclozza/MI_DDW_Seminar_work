According to the 2012 census, the commune has a population of 11,132 and has an area of 20,405.1\u00a0km2 (7,878\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.ine.cl/canales/chile_estadistico/censos_poblacion_vivienda/censo_pobl_vivi.php\", \"title\": \"National Statistics Institute\", \"language\": \"es\", \"accessdate\": \"3 November 2010\"}\nThe commune is home to Paranal Observatory and includes the northern portion of Pan de Az\u00facar National Park.\n\nEtymology\nThe etymological origin of the name is the indigenous word Thalthal, which means \u201cnight bird.\u201d[3]\n\nHistory\nThe history of Taltal begins with the opening of the copper mine \"El Cobre\" by Jos\u00e9 Antonio Moreno in 1850 about 20 kilometers north of Taltal.  This brought miners and prospectors to the area. In 1855 Moreno expanded his operations to include Taltal.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.taltal.cl/contenido/44/historia\", \"title\": \"Taltal: Un puerto nacido del empuje\", \"publisher\": \"Municipalidad de Taltal\", \"language\": \"es\", \"urlstatus\": \"live\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20130725152531/http://www.taltal.cl/contenido/44/historia\", \"archivedate\": \"25 July 2013\"} The discovery of copper in 1858 on nearby Mount Cachiyuyal increased pressure on the port, which had to utilize customs officials from Copiapo. So Moreno requested official recognition of the port which was granted by decree[5] on 12 July 1858.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.taltal.cl/contenido/44/historia\", \"title\": \"Taltal: Un puerto nacido del empuje\", \"publisher\": \"Municipalidad de Taltal\", \"language\": \"es\", \"urlstatus\": \"live\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20130725152531/http://www.taltal.cl/contenido/44/historia\", \"archivedate\": \"25 July 2013\"}\nHowever, the real boom began in 1876 with the opening of nitrate mines, in particular potassium nitrate.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.taltal.cl/contenido/44/historia\", \"title\": \"Taltal: Un puerto nacido del empuje\", \"publisher\": \"Municipalidad de Taltal\", \"language\": \"es\", \"urlstatus\": \"live\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20130725152531/http://www.taltal.cl/contenido/44/historia\", \"archivedate\": \"25 July 2013\"} In 1879, the first nitrates were shipped from the area.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.taltal.cl/noticias/582/caleta-oliva-un-hito-historico\", \"title\": \"Caleta Oliva, Un Hito Hist\\u00f3rico\", \"date\": \"23 June 2008\", \"publisher\": \"Municipalidad de Taltal\", \"language\": \"es\", \"urlstatus\": \"live\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20150811002743/http://www.taltal.cl/noticias/582/caleta-oliva-un-hito-historico\", \"archivedate\": \"11 August 2015\"} In 1882 a railway was completed from Cachinal de la Sierra and other nitrate mining sites. It was built by the \"Taltal Railway Company\", a British company, sold to private investors in 1954, and dismantled in 1970 due to the end of nitrate mining. At the peak of production in the 1930s, Taltal had a population of over 30,000 and was the third largest nitrate port in Chile.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.taltal.cl/contenido/44/historia\", \"title\": \"Taltal: Un puerto nacido del empuje\", \"publisher\": \"Municipalidad de Taltal\", \"language\": \"es\", \"urlstatus\": \"live\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20130725152531/http://www.taltal.cl/contenido/44/historia\", \"archivedate\": \"25 July 2013\"}\n\nDemographics\nAccording to the 2002 census of the National Statistics Institute, Taltal had 11,000 inhabitants (6,182 men and 4,918 women).
