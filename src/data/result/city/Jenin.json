On 25 August 1938, the day after the British Assistant District Commissioner was assassinated in his Jenin office, a large British force with explosives entered the town. After ordering the inhabitants to leave, about one quarter of the town was blown up.[24]\nJenin was used by Fawzi al-Qawuqji's Arab Liberation Army as a base.\n\n1948 War\nIn the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War, the city was defended by the Iraqi Army, then captured briefly by the forces from Israel's Carmeli Brigade during the \"Ten Days' fighting\" following the cancellation of the first cease-fire. Prior to the battle, the city's residents fled temporarily.[25] The offensive was actually a feint designed to draw Arab forces away from the critical Siege of Jerusalem, and gains in that sector were quickly abandoned when Arab reinforcements arrived.\n\nJordanian control\nIn the wake of the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War, and after the 1949 Armistice Agreements, Jenin came under Jordanian rule. It was annexed by Jordan in 1950.\nThe Jenin refugee camp was founded in 1953 by Jordan to house displaced Palestinians who fled or were expelled during the 1948 War. In 2014 the camp had a population of 16,000. For 19 years, the city was under Jordanian control. A war cemetery for Iraqi soldiers and local combatants is located on the outskirts of Jenin.\nThe Jordanian census of 1961 found 14,402 inhabitants in Jenin.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"url\": \"http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/yabber/census/JordanCensus1961bits.pdf\", \"title \": \"First Census of Population and Housing.

A 37-year-old man who was paralysed was crushed under the rubble of his house, his family was refused to be allowed to remove his body. A 14-year-old boy was killed as he travelled to purchase groceries during the temporary relief of the curfew that was imposed by the army. Medical staff were shot at (one nurse killed) while trying to reach the wounded even after clearly being in uniform displaying the red crescent symbol.[33] There have also been reports of Israeli soldiers using Palestinians as human shields, one father described how a soldier rested his rifle on his 14-year-old son's shoulder as he shot.[34] Israel denied the entry of rescue teams and journalists into Jenin even after they withdrew.
