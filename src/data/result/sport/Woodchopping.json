    "content": "Woodchopping\nWoodchopping (also spelled wood-chopping or wood chopping), called woodchop for short, is a sport that has been around for hundreds of years in several cultures. In woodchopping competitions, skilled contestants attempt to be the first to cut or saw through a log or other block of wood. It is often held at state fairs and agricultural shows.  Participants (especially men) are often referred to as axemen.\n\nHistory\nThe modern sport of woodchopping is said to have had its genesis in 1870 in Ulverstone, Tasmania, as the result of a \u00a325 ($50) bet between two axemen as to who could first fell a tree.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.nswaxemen.asn.au/Introduction/Introduction.html\", \"title\": \"Introduction to woodchopping\", \"publisher\": \"Nswaxemen.asn.au\", \"author\": \"Andrew\"} An alternative origin story comes from 16th century Basque Country, in which a man ran a marathon and chop ten logs to be allowed to propose to his future wife.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://barbend.com/woodchopping-best-strength-workout-youve-never-tried/\", \"title\": \"Woodchopping Is the Best Strength Workout You've Never Tried - BarBend\", \"website\": \"BarBend\", \"accessdate\": \"24 January 2017\", \"last1\": \"English\", \"first1\": \"Nick\"}\nThe world's first woodchopping championship was held in 1891, at Bell's Parade, Latrobe, Tasmania.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.axemanscomplex.com.au/history.html\", \"title\": \"History of the Australian Axeman's Hall of Fame & Timberworks &#124; Latrobe &#124; Tasmania &#124; Australia\", \"publisher\": \"Axemanscomplex.com.au\", \"accessdate\": \"2012-03-06\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20120426045230/http://www.axemanscomplex.com.au/history.html\"} This event was celebrated and commemorated with the selection of the site to be the home of the Australian Axemen's Hall of Fame and Timberworks.\n\nAreas of practice\nWoodchopping is practiced in regions where forestry is or has been an important part of the economy:\n\nEvents\nMany woodchopping events are handicap events, where the axemen start at different times, depending on how fast they are expected to chop through the log. In New Zealand and parts of Australia, each axeman's individual handicap is recorded in performance books which are graded on how many events they win and how many events they enter. Championship events are scratch events with no handicap, and typically use larger diameter logs (375\u00a0mm).\nHandicap events may use logs of 250\u00a0mm to 350\u00a0mm, depending on the skill of the competitors. All competitors have the same size log; the handicap is based purely on time.\n\nStanding block\nThis event is done by an individual cutting a scarf in one side.  Once the first side has been completed the individual starts cutting another scarf on the opposite side, slightly higher than the first, generally about two inches higher but can vary with each axeman\u2019s individual preference.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://axemen.co.nz/\", \"title\": \"New Zealand Axemen's News\", \"publisher\": \"Axemen.co.nz\"}\n\nUnderhand\nIn this event, the axeman stands on the top of the log and uses a downwards motion to chop the log in two as fast as possible.  This is done by cutting a scarf in the front side and then turning around on the block and completing it from the other side. These scarfs are generally offset from each other, the degree of offset depending on the size of the log and the axeman\u2019s preference.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://axemen.co.nz/\", \"title\": \"New Zealand Axemen's News\", \"publisher\": \"Axemen.co.nz\"}\n\nTree felling\nIn this event the axeman cuts a small pocket in the side of a pole and jams a wooden jigger board with a metal shoe on the end of it into the hole. The shoe is designed to grip into the wood when pressure is put on it from the top. After the axeman has climbed onto his first board he then cuts another pocket and so on. Once up on his top board he proceeds to cut the block on the top of the pole.\nThere are two distinct versions of tree felling:\n\nSingle saw or single buck\nThis event is often considered the hardest discipline in woodchopping. The competitor pulls and pushes a razor sharp saw specifically designed for the event. The saws vary in length from five foot six inches to six foot four inches. The saws cost between $1500 and $2000.\n\nDouble saw or double buck\nThis event consists of two people pulling and pushing a saw to cut a log. It is far faster than the single saw event as there are two people using the saw yet times for this event can be two or three times faster in the same size wood.  The saws used in double tend to be a lot hungrier, that is, they cut and draw more wood out with each stroke. This, however, makes it far harder to push and pull the saw.\n\nStock saw\nIn this event the axemen use identically tuned and sharpened chainsaws to cut through a log, once downwards and once upwards, within a 3-inch space of wood. The competitor starts with their hands on top of the log. On a buzzer the axeman picks up the saw and pulls the starting cord and then makes his first cut downward, then his second cut upward. If the saw does not start that is just bad luck and they get a slow time. If the axeman takes over more than the allocated wood then they are disqualified and no time is recorded.[6]\n\nHot saw\nThis event is often the crowd's favourite[citation needed], and certainly the loudest. It uses a large homemade methanol-run chainsaw. The saws used by top competitors are typically snowmobile engines cut in half and are far heavier than regular chainsaws.  The start for this event is exactly the same as the stock saw except the log is bigger and the axeman has to do three cuts: the first in a downwards motion, the second upwards, and the third down. This event is the fastest by far, lasting between five and seven seconds.[6]\n\nDifferent types of woods\nMany different types of wood are used in the sport and they vary between countries. Common woods used in competition in Australia are gum, mountain ash, woolley butt and poplar. The most common woods cut in New Zealand are radiata pine (Pinus radiata), poplar and Pinus strobus. Woods cut in America include white pine, alder, aspen frozen wood and cotton wood.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.tuatahiaxes.com/\", \"title\": \"Tuatahi Racing Axes and Saws\", \"publisher\": \"Tuatahiaxes.com\"}\n\nWoodchopping by country\nThe rules of the sport vary from country to country.\n\nAustralia\nWoodchopping events in Australia are generally run in conjunction with agricultural shows. Competitions can run for up to 10 days, with over 100 competitors at each show.\nIn the Jack Pollard's 1968 or 1969 editions of the Ampol's Australian Sporting Records woodchopping records appear to run from the 1920s [8]\nThe Axeman's Hall of Fame is located in Latrobe, Tasmania.[citation needed] The peak body for the sport in Australia is the Australian Axemen's Association.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.australianaxemen.org.au/\", \"title\": \"Woodchopping\", \"website\": \"Australian Axemen's Association\"}\n\nBasque Country\nThe sport is called aizkolaritza in Basque from aizkolari \"wood-chopper\".  The sport is very popular and competitions are common at most festivals.\n\nNew Zealand\nNew Zealand is a leading country in the sport of woodchopping, having had the world's top two competitors; Jason Wynyard, and David Bolstad who died in November 2011. Competitions are generally held at A & P shows, but there are also shows dedicated to wood chopping.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://axemen.co.nz/\", \"title\": \"New Zealand Axemen's News\", \"publisher\": \"Axemen.co.nz\"}\n",
