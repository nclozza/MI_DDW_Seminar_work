    "content": "Poohsticks\n\nPoohsticks is a game first mentioned in The House at Pooh Corner, a Winnie-the-Pooh book by A. A. Milne. It is a simple game which may be played on any bridge over running water; each player drops a stick on the upstream side of a bridge and the one whose stick first appears on the downstream side is the winner. The annual World Poohsticks Championships have been held at Day's Lock on the River Thames in the UK since 1984.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"2006-03-27\", \"title\": \"23rd world Pooh-sticks race held\", \"url\": \"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/oxfordshire/4845136.stm\", \"publisher\": \"[[BBC]]\", \"accessdate\": \"2008-11-03\"}\n\nHistory\nPoohsticks was invented by English author A. A. Milne for his son Christopher Robin Milne.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://pooh-sticks.com/\", \"title\": \"Pooh, Piglet, Tigger and You\", \"date\": \"1998-03-13\", \"publisher\": \"BBC\", \"accessdate\": \"2017-05-29\"} The game first came to prominence when it was described in the author's book The House at Pooh Corner[3] as well as in the Disney animated featurette Winnie the Pooh and a Day for Eeyore. Winnie-the-Pooh, the protagonist of the book, accidentally drops a pine cone into a river from a bridge and, after observing how it appeared on the other side of the bridge, devises the rules for Poohsticks. Pooh continues to play the game with the other characters, Christopher Robin, Tigger and Eeyore.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"2003-03-16\", \"title\": \"New 'pooh-sticks' World Champion\", \"url\": \"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2853091.stm\", \"publisher\": \"[[BBC]]\", \"accessdate\": \"2008-11-03\"}{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"2008-11-02\", \"title\": \"Poohsticks fans club together to save the game\", \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/nov/02/uk-news\", \"location\": \"London\", \"accessdate\": \"2008-11-03\", \"last\": \"Davies\", \"first\": \"Caroline\", \"newspaper\": \"[[The Observer]]\"}\nThe game was first played at a bridge located in Ashdown Forest, close to the village of Upper Hartfield, East Sussex, England. Built in 1907 and originally called Posingford Bridge, it is considered to be the bridge on which Milne and his son first played the game.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"2008-11-02\", \"title\": \"Poohsticks fans club together to save the game\", \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/nov/02/uk-news\", \"location\": \"London\", \"accessdate\": \"2008-11-03\", \"last\": \"Davies\", \"first\": \"Caroline\", \"newspaper\": \"[[The Observer]]\"}{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"1999-09-11\", \"title\": \"Disney to save Pooh Bridge\", \"url\": \"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/444815.stm\", \"publisher\": \"[[BBC]]\", \"accessdate\": \"2008-11-03\"} However, it is uncertain whether the game was first played at the bridge and then written into the story, or vice versa.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://pooh-sticks.com/\", \"title\": \"Pooh, Piglet, Tigger and You\", \"date\": \"1998-03-13\", \"publisher\": \"BBC\", \"accessdate\": \"2017-05-29\"} The bridge maintained the public's interest and a campaign to rebuild it in the late seventies was considered important enough to feature on the BBC Nine\u00a0O'Clock News. The bridge was subsequently reopened by Christopher Robin Milne and officially renamed as Poohsticks Bridge.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.poohcorner.com/A-Short-History-of-Pooh-and-Winnie.html\", \"title\": \"A Short History of Pooh and Winnie\", \"publisher\": \"PoohCorner\", \"accessdate\": \"2008-11-03\"}\nThe site was so popular that in 1999 the East Sussex county council made an appeal to Disney as the old wooden bridge had been worn down by an overwhelming number of visitors.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"1999-08-10\", \"title\": \"Appeal to save Winnie the Pooh's bridge\", \"url\": \"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/416892.stm\", \"publisher\": \"[[BBC]]\", \"accessdate\": \"2008-11-03\"} The company provided a substantial donation towards the estimated \u00a330,000 needed to replace the bridge. Partly rebuilt in 1979, the donations from Disney, building firms and members of the public funded its complete reconstruction. The newly built and modernised bridge retained its precursor's original style.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"2008-03-21\", \"title\": \"Great escapes: Days out with a difference\", \"url\": \"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/great-escapes-days-out-with-a-difference-798923.html\", \"location\": \"London\", \"accessdate\": \"2008-11-03\", \"last\": \"Halstead\", \"first\": \"Robin\", \"newspaper\": \"[[The Independent]]\"} A plaque was also placed to commemorate the occasion and thank those who financially contributed to the project.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"1999-09-11\", \"title\": \"Disney to save Pooh Bridge\", \"url\": \"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/444815.stm\", \"publisher\": \"[[BBC]]\", \"accessdate\": \"2008-11-03\"} The game can still be played in Ashdown Forest to this day and the site regularly attracts tourists from as far afield as the United States and Japan.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"1999-08-10\", \"title\": \"Appeal to save Winnie the Pooh's bridge\", \"url\": \"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/416892.stm\", \"publisher\": \"[[BBC]]\", \"accessdate\": \"2008-11-03\"} However, visitors are now advised to bring their own sticks, as previous visitors have caused damage to the trees in the vicinity.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://pooh-sticks.com/\", \"title\": \"Pooh, Piglet, Tigger and You\", \"date\": \"1998-03-13\", \"publisher\": \"BBC\", \"accessdate\": \"2017-05-29\"}{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"2004-10-19\", \"title\": \"Want to win at Pooh Sticks?

Originally these took place at Day's Lock on the River Thames near Dorchester-on-Thames, Oxfordshire. but were later moved to Langel Common in Witney, also in Oxfordshire, and have attracted over 1,500 visitors, including many from overseas.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"2003-03-16\", \"title\": \"New 'pooh-sticks' World Champion\", \"url\": \"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2853091.stm\", \"publisher\": \"[[BBC]]\", \"accessdate\": \"2008-11-03\"} The championships features an individual event and a four-person team event.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://pooh-sticks.com/\", \"title\": \"Pooh, Piglet, Tigger and You\", \"date\": \"1998-03-13\", \"publisher\": \"BBC\", \"accessdate\": \"2017-05-29\"} Players come from a wide variety of countries including the United States, Japan, Kenya, Australia and England.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"2003-03-16\", \"title\": \"New 'pooh-sticks' World Champion\", \"url\": \"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2853091.stm\", \"publisher\": \"[[BBC]]\", \"accessdate\": \"2008-11-03\"}{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"2008-11-02\", \"title\": \"Poohsticks fans club together to save the game\", \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/nov/02/uk-news\", \"location\": \"London\", \"accessdate\": \"2008-11-03\", \"last\": \"Davies\", \"first\": \"Caroline\", \"newspaper\": \"[[The Observer]]\"}{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.bbc.co.uk/oxford/content/articles/2007/03/12/world_poohsticks.shtml\", \"title\": \"It's Pooh Sticks Time!\", \"date\": \"2007-12-23\", \"publisher\": \"BBC\", \"accessdate\": \"2008-11-03\"} Before its move to Witney, the event took place from Little Wittenham Bridge but now uses a bridge over the River Windrush near Cogges Manor Farm.\nThe sporting event was started at Little Wittenham Bridge in 1984 by the lockkeeper, Lynn David, as a fund-raising event for the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI).{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://pooh-sticks.com/\", \"title\": \"Pooh, Piglet, Tigger and You\", \"date\": \"1998-03-13\", \"publisher\": \"BBC\", \"accessdate\": \"2017-05-29\"} He noticed that people occasionally snapped sticks from nearby hedges to play the game and he then came up with the idea of a competition to aid the charity.

The Sinodun president, David Caswell, stated: \"The trouble is there is a lot of heavy work staging the event. Some of our members are over 70, and it was just getting too much\". However, the Rotary Club of Oxford Spires declared that its members would continue hosting the event, thus preserving the competition for future generations. The President of Oxford Spires for 2008\u20132009, Liz Williamson, stressed that it should continue as the event was popular locally and demonstrated quirky English nature to a worldwide audience.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"2008-11-02\", \"title\": \"Poohsticks fans club together to save the game\", \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/nov/02/uk-news\", \"location\": \"London\", \"accessdate\": \"2008-11-03\", \"last\": \"Davies\", \"first\": \"Caroline\", \"newspaper\": \"[[The Observer]]\"}\nThe organisers announced in January 2015 that they had decided that the Little Wittenham site was no longer suitable, citing increasing logistical difficulties as the event had become more popular and the use of the land had changed. In June the World Championships were held at their new home, one of the cycle-track bridges over the River Windrush on Langel Common, near the Cogges Manor Farm Museum in Witney, Oxfordshire. The new location still retains a rural atmosphere but is a few minutes' walk from Witney town centre with its convenient public transport links to Oxford. Car parking is also much closer than at the original venue, a factor that influenced the choice of venue. For the first year at the new location, the organizers decided not to hold the 2015 team games,[19] but team games were restored in 2016. The move to the new venue also allowed the event to move to June when the weather is likely to be better.\n\nWinners\nThe winners of both the individual and team events receive a trophy, and the second- and third-placed individuals and teams also receive a smaller trophy. Despite claims that the game involves skill more than luck, no team or individual has ever won the competition more than once. The individual competition usually involves winning three rounds of matches before receiving an entry to the final.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"2008-11-02\", \"title\": \"Poohsticks fans club together to save the game\", \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/nov/02/uk-news\", \"location\": \"London\", \"accessdate\": \"2008-11-03\", \"last\": \"Davies\", \"first\": \"Caroline\", \"newspaper\": \"[[The Observer]]\"}\n\nRotary Club of Oxford Spires\nAlthough not a Poohsticks Society as such, the Rotary Club of Oxford Spires{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.oxfordspiresrotary.org.uk\", \"title\": \"The Oxford Spires Rotary Club\", \"publisher\": \"Rotary Club of Oxford Spires\", \"accessdate\": \"2014-04-12\"} is responsible for the World Pooh Sticks Championships held annually since 1983 at Days Lock on the River Thames then in Witney since 2015.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"2011-03-27\", \"title\": \"Girl wins Oxfordshire World Pooh Sticks Championships\", \"url\": \"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-oxfordshire-12874674\", \"work\": \"[[BBC Online]]\", \"accessdate\": \"27 March 2011\"} The Championships were voted 'Britain's Favourite Quirky Event' by Countryfile magazine readers in 2012{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.pooh-sticks.com/node/219\", \"title\": \"CountryFile Awards at Poohsticks.com\", \"publisher\": \"Rotary Club of Oxford Spires\", \"accessdate\": \"2014-04-12\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20140407091312/http://www.pooh-sticks.com/node/219\", \"archivedate\": \"2014-04-07\"} and are carried out with the aim of raising money for a variety of charities.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.pooh-sticks.com/content/all-you-need-know-2014\", \"title\": \"All you need to know for 2014 at Poohsticks.com\", \"publisher\": \"Rotary Club of Oxford Spires\", \"accessdate\": \"2014-04-12\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20140407091325/http://www.pooh-sticks.com/content/all-you-need-know-2014\", \"archivedate\": \"2014-04-07\"}\n\nMagdalen College Pooh Sticks Society\nRevival of the Oxford University Pooh Sticks Society has begun thanks to students in Magdalen College, Oxford, with the creation of the Magdalen College Pooh Sticks Society (MCPSS) founded in April 2013 which mixes classic Pooh Sticks games with commentary and rules in the style of radio programme I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue.

The popularity of the game was underlined when it featured as a question on long-running British quiz series University Challenge.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"2008-11-02\", \"title\": \"Poohsticks fans club together to save the game\", \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/nov/02/uk-news\", \"location\": \"London\", \"accessdate\": \"2008-11-03\", \"last\": \"Davies\", \"first\": \"Caroline\", \"newspaper\": \"[[The Observer]]\"}\nThe \"Pooh-stick method\" of estimating the flow of a stream gets its name from the use of one or more floating objects (typically passing under a bridge of known width) to calculate the speed at which the water is flowing.[40][41]\nTerry Pratchett mentioned the game in Thud! (2005) as a popular children's game played in the gutters during Sam Vimes' childhood in Ankh-Morpork, originally called \"turd races\" before renaming it \"poohsticks\" to take the game upmarket.\nJulia Donaldson mentioned the game in her children's book Stick Man (2008) when the protagonist, Stickman, is used by a girl in a game of Poohsticks.\nIn Season 14, Episode 2 (2010) of Midsomer Murders a group of children play Poohsticks, as DCI John Barnaby and DS Ben Jones drive by. Jones instructs children not to play on the road, Barnaby explains the game to Jones and recommends him to hang on to childhood poetry. The still-playing children later find a dead body floating in the stream.\nIn Season 5, Episode 7 (2014) of Downton Abbey, Tom Branson and young Sybil play a game of Poohsticks, without referencing the game by name, while he is telling her of his idea to leave Downton and move them to Boston.\nThe partly fictitious 1980s Swansea power pop band The Pooh Sticks was named as both a homage to the game, and as a description of the factual or habitual sticky qualities of lowercase pooh.[citation needed]\nThe song \"Twydale's Lament\" by British band Half Man Half Biscuit, on their 2005 album Achtung Bono, includes the line, \"I saw a young professional couple playing poohsticks on a Cotswold bridge\".{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://halfmanhalfbiscuit.uk/achtung-bono-2005/twydales-lament/\", \"title\": \"Twydale's Lament\", \"website\": \"halfmanhalfbiscuit.uk\", \"accessdate\": \"1 July 2019\"}\n\nExternal links\n\n",
