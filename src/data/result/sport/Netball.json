Netball is most popular in many Commonwealth nations, specifically in schools, and is predominantly played by women. According to the INF, netball is played by more than 20 million people in more than 80 countries.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.netball.org/ifna.aspx\", \"title\": \"About IFNA\", \"accessdate\": \"23 August 2011\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20110308132327/http://www.netball.org/IFNA.aspx\", \"archivedate\": \"8 March 2011\", \"ref\": \"harv\", \"author\": \"International Federation of Netball Associations\", \"df\": \"dmy-all\"}[13] Major domestic leagues in the sport include the Netball Superleague in Great Britain, Suncorp Super Netball in Australia and the ANZ Premiership in New Zealand. Four major competitions take place internationally: the quadrennial World Netball Championships, the Commonwealth Games, and the yearly Quad Series and Fast5 Series. In 1995, netball became an International Olympic Committee recognised sport, but it has not been played at the Olympics.\nGames are played on a rectangular court with raised goal rings at each end. Each team attempts to score goals by passing a ball down the court and shooting it through its goal ring. Players are assigned specific positions, which define their roles within the team and restrict their movement to certain areas of the court. During general play, a player with the ball can hold on to it for only three seconds before shooting for a goal or passing to another player. The winning team is the one that scores the most goals. Netball games are 60 minutes long. Variations have been developed to increase the game's pace and appeal to a wider audience.\nIts development, derived from early versions of basketball, began in England in the 1890s. By 1960, international playing rules had been standardised for the game, and the International Federation of Netball and Women's Basketball (later renamed the International Netball Federation (INF)) was formed. As of 2019, the INF comprises more than 70 national teams organized into five global regions.\n\nHistory\nNetball emerged from early versions of basketball and evolved into its own sport as the number of women participating in sports increased. Basketball was invented in 1891 by James Naismith in the United States. The game was initially played indoors between two teams of nine players, using an association football that was thrown into closed-end peach baskets.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"last1\": \"Grundy\", \"first1\": \"Pamela\", \"last2\": \"Shackelford\", \"first2\": \"Susan\", \"year\": \"2007\", \"title\": \"Shattering the Glass: The Remarkable History of Women's Basketball\", \"publisher\": \"University of North Carolina Press\", \"isbn\": \"978-0-8078-5829-5\", \"oclc\": \"58431871\", \"ref\": \"harv\"} Naismith's game spread quickly across the United States and variations of the rules soon emerged. Physical education instructor Senda Berenson developed modified rules for women in 1892; these eventually gave rise to women's basketball. Around this time separate intercollegiate rules were developed for men and women.{\"citetype\": \"journal\", \"last1\": \"Jobling\", \"first1\": \"Ian\", \"last2\": \"Barham\", \"first2\": \"Pamela\", \"date\": \"November 1991\", \"title\": \"The Development of Netball and the All-Australia Women's Basketball Association (AAWBBA): 1891\\u20131939\", \"url\": \"http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/SportingTraditions/1991/st0801/st0801e.pdf\", \"journal\": \"Sporting Traditions, Journal of the Australian Society for Sports History\", \"volume\": \"8\", \"issue\": \"1\", \"pages\": \"30\\u201348\", \"ref\": \"harv\"} The various basketball rules converged into a universal set in the United States.\nMartina Bergman-\u00d6sterberg introduced a version of basketball in 1893 to her female students at the Physical Training College in Hampstead, London.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"1968\", \"title\": \"Physical Education in England Since 1800\", \"location\": \"London\", \"publisher\": \"Bell\", \"isbn\": \"0-7135-0689-X\", \"oclc\": \"41636\", \"ref\": \"harv\", \"last\": \"McIntosh\", \"first\": \"Peter C.\"} The rules of the game were modified at the college over several years: the game moved outdoors and was played on grass; the baskets were replaced by rings that had nets; and in 1897 and 1899, rules from women's basketball in the United States were incorporated.{\"citetype\": \"journal\", \"last1\": \"Jobling\", \"first1\": \"Ian\", \"last2\": \"Barham\", \"first2\": \"Pamela\", \"date\": \"November 1991\", \"title\": \"The Development of Netball and the All-Australia Women's Basketball Association (AAWBBA): 1891\\u20131939\", \"url\": \"http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/SportingTraditions/1991/st0801/st0801e.pdf\", \"journal\": \"Sporting Traditions, Journal of the Australian Society for Sports History\", \"volume\": \"8\", \"issue\": \"1\", \"pages\": \"30\\u201348\", \"ref\": \"harv\"}{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"1976\", \"title\": \"Golden Jubilee: 1926\\u20131976\", \"publisher\": \"All England Netball Association\", \"oclc\": \"39500756\", \"ref\": \"harv\", \"author\": \"All England Netball Association\"} \u00d6sterberg's new sport acquired the name \"net ball\".{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.englandnetball.co.uk/about-england-netball/history_of_england_netball\", \"title\": \"History of England Netball (1891\\u20132008)\", \"accessdate\": \"4 March 2011\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20110719151135/https://www.englandnetball.co.uk/about-england-netball/history_of_england_netball\", \"archivedate\": \"19 July 2011\", \"ref\": \"harv\", \"author\": \"England Netball\", \"df\": \"dmy-all\"} The first codified rules of netball were published in 1901 by the Ling Association, later the Physical Education Association of the United Kingdom.{\"citetype\": \"journal\", \"date\": \"November 2001\", \"title\": \"Gendering Sport: The Development of Netball in Australia\", \"url\": \"http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/SportingTraditions/2001/st1801/ST1801i.pdf\", \"journal\": \"Sporting Traditions, Journal of the Australian Society for Sports History\", \"volume\": \"18\", \"issue\": \"1\", \"pages\": \"57\\u201374\", \"ref\": \"harv\", \"last\": \"Taylor\", \"first\": \"Tracy\"}{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"2007\", \"title\": \"The Sports Book\", \"url\": \"https://archive.org/details/sportsbookgamesr0000unse_f5t8/page/162\", \"location\": \"New York\", \"publisher\": \"DK Publishing\", \"pages\": \"[https://archive.org/details/sportsbookgamesr0000unse_f5t8/page/162 162\\u2013165]\", \"isbn\": \"978-0-7566-3195-6\", \"ref\": \"harv\", \"last\": \"Summers\", \"first\": \"David\"} From England, netball spread to other countries in the British Empire.

The goal rings are 380 millimetres (15\u00a0in) in diameter and sit atop 3.05-metre (10.0\u00a0ft)-high goal posts that have no backboards.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.netball.asn.au/extra.asp?id=29&OrgID=1&menu=10706\", \"title\": \"Court & venue specifications\", \"publisher\": \"[[Netball Australia]]\", \"accessdate\": \"2 March 2011\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20110227072539/http://netball.asn.au//extra.asp?id=29&OrgID=1&menu=10706\", \"archivedate\": \"27 February 2011\", \"ref\": \"harv\", \"author\": \"Netball Australia\", \"df\": \"dmy-all\"} A 4.9-metre (16\u00a0ft)-radius semi-circular \"shooting circle\" is an area at each end of the court.

The ball is usually made of leather or rubber, measures 680 to 710 millimetres (27 to 28\u00a0in) in circumference (~22 centimetres (8.7\u00a0in) in diameter), and weighs 397 to 454 grams (14.0 to 16.0\u00a0oz).[46][47] A normal game consists of four 15-minute quarters[46][48] and can be played outdoors or in a covered stadium.\nEach team is allowed seven players on the court.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.internationalnetball.com/netball_rules.html\", \"title\": \"netball rules\", \"date\": \"September 2006\", \"publisher\": \"International Netball\", \"accessdate\": \"28 February 2011\", \"ref\": \"harv\", \"author\": \"International Netball\"} Each player is assigned a specific position, which limits their movement to a certain area of the court. A \"bib\" worn by each player contains a one- or two-letter abbreviation indicating this position.[50] Only two positions are permitted in the attacking shooting circle, and can therefore shoot for a goal. Similarly, only two positions are permitted in the defensive shooting circle; they try to prevent the opposition from shooting goals. Other players are restricted to two thirds of the court, with the exception of the Centre, who may move anywhere on the court except for a shooting circle.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"last1\": \"Hickey\", \"first1\": \"Julia\", \"last2\": \"Navin\", \"first2\": \"Anita\", \"year\": \"2007\", \"title\": \"Understanding netball\", \"publisher\": \"Coachwise\", \"isbn\": \"978-1-905540-12-9\", \"oclc\": \"174094782\", \"ref\": \"harv\"}\nAt the beginning of every quarter and after a goal has been scored, play starts with a player in the centre position passing the ball from the centre of the court. These \"centre passes\" alternate between the teams, regardless of which team scored the last goal. When the umpire blows the whistle to restart play, four players from each team can move into the centre third to receive the pass. The centre pass must be caught or touched in the centre third.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"last1\": \"Shakespear\", \"first1\": \"Wilma\", \"last2\": \"Caldow\", \"first2\": \"Margaret\", \"year\": \"2009\", \"title\": \"Netball : steps to success\", \"url\": \"https://archive.org/details/netballstepstosu0000shak\", \"location\": \"Champaign, Illinois\", \"publisher\": \"Human Kinetics\", \"isbn\": \"978-0-7360-7984-6\", \"oclc\": \"251227987\", \"ref\": \"harv\", \"urlaccess\": \"registration\"}[53] The ball is then moved up and down the court through passing and must be touched by a player in each adjacent third of the court. Players can hold the ball for only three seconds at any time. It must be released before the foot they were standing on when they caught it touches the ground again.[46] Contact between players is only permitted if it does not impede an opponent or the general play. When defending a pass or shot players must be at least 90 centimetres (35\u00a0in) away from the player with the ball. If illegal contact is made, the player who contacted cannot participate in play until the player taking the penalty has passed or shot the ball.[54] If the ball is held in two hands and either dropped or a shot at goal is missed, the same player cannot be the first to touch it unless it first rebounds off the goal.[55]\n\nIndoor netball\nIndoor netball is a variation of netball, played exclusively indoors, in which the playing court is often surrounded on each side and overhead by a net. The net prevents the ball from leaving the court, permitting faster play by reducing playing stoppages.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"2003\", \"title\": \"The South African dictionary of sport\", \"publisher\": \"Spearhead\", \"isbn\": \"0-86486-535-X\", \"oclc\": \"249075345\", \"ref\": \"harv\", \"last\": \"Alswang\", \"first\": \"Joel\"}\nDifferent forms of indoor netball exist.
