Netball is most popular in many Commonwealth nations, specifically in schools, and is predominantly played by women. According to the INF, netball is played by more than 20 million people in more than 80 countries.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.netball.org/ifna.aspx\", \"title\": \"About IFNA\", \"accessdate\": \"23 August 2011\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20110308132327/http://www.netball.org/IFNA.aspx\", \"archivedate\": \"8 March 2011\", \"ref\": \"harv\", \"author\": \"International Federation of Netball Associations\"}{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"date\": \"December 2002\", \"chapter\": \"Women and sport in New Zealand\", \"editor1last\": \"Pfister\", \"editor1first\": \"Gertrud\", \"title\": \"Sport and Women: Social Issues in International Perspective\", \"series\": \"International Society for Comparative Physical Education & Sport\", \"location\": \"New York\", \"publisher\": \"[[Routledge]]\", \"isbn\": \"0-415-24628-8\", \"oclc\": \"50204306\", \"last\": \"Thompson\", \"first\": \"Shona M.\", \"editor2last\": \"Hartmann-Tews\", \"editor2first\": \"Ilse\"} Major domestic leagues in the sport include the Netball Superleague in Great Britain, Suncorp Super Netball in Australia and the ANZ Premiership in New Zealand. Four major competitions take place internationally: the quadrennial World Netball Championships, the Commonwealth Games, and the yearly Quad Series and Fast5 Series. In 1995, netball became an International Olympic Committee recognised sport, but it has not been played at the Olympics.\nGames are played on a rectangular court with raised goal rings at each end. Each team attempts to score goals by passing a ball down the court and shooting it through its goal ring. Players are assigned specific positions, which define their roles within the team and restrict their movement to certain areas of the court. During general play, a player with the ball can hold on to it for only three seconds before shooting for a goal or passing to another player. The winning team is the one that scores the most goals. Netball games are 60 minutes long. Variations have been developed to increase the game's pace and appeal to a wider audience.\nIts development, derived from early versions of basketball, began in England in the 1890s. By 1960, international playing rules had been standardised for the game, and the International Federation of Netball and Women's Basketball (later renamed the International Netball Federation (INF)) was formed. As of 2019, the INF comprises more than 70 national teams organized into five global regions.\n\nHistory\nNetball emerged from early versions of basketball and evolved into its own sport as the number of women participating in sports increased. Basketball was invented in 1891 by James Naismith in the United States. The game was initially played indoors between two teams of nine players, using an association football that was thrown into closed-end peach baskets.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"last1\": \"Grundy\", \"first1\": \"Pamela\", \"last2\": \"Shackelford\", \"first2\": \"Susan\", \"year\": \"2007\", \"title\": \"Shattering the Glass: The Remarkable History of Women's Basketball\", \"publisher\": \"University of North Carolina Press\", \"isbn\": \"978-0-8078-5829-5\", \"oclc\": \"58431871\"} Naismith's game spread quickly across the United States and variations of the rules soon emerged. Physical education instructor Senda Berenson developed modified rules for women in 1892; these eventually gave rise to women's basketball.

objective of a game is to score more goals than the opposition. Goals are scored when a team member positioned in the attacking shooting circle shoots the ball through the goal ring. The goal rings are 380 millimetres (15\u00a0in) in diameter and sit atop 3.05-metre (10.0\u00a0ft)-high goal posts that have no backboards.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.netball.asn.au/extra.asp?id=29&OrgID=1&menu=10706\", \"title\": \"Court & venue specifications\", \"publisher\": \"[[Netball Australia]]\", \"accessdate\": \"2 March 2011\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20110227072539/http://netball.asn.au//extra.asp?id=29&OrgID=1&menu=10706\", \"archivedate\": \"27 February 2011\", \"ref\": \"harv\", \"author\": \"Netball Australia\"} A 4.9-metre (16\u00a0ft)-radius semi-circular \"shooting circle\" is an area at each end of the court.

A \"bib\" worn by each player contains a one- or two-letter abbreviation indicating this position.[50] Only two positions are permitted in the attacking shooting circle, and can therefore shoot for a goal. Similarly, only two positions are permitted in the defensive shooting circle; they try to prevent the opposition from shooting goals. Other players are restricted to two thirds of the court, with the exception of the Centre, who may move anywhere on the court except for a shooting circle.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"last1\": \"Hickey\", \"first1\": \"Julia\", \"last2\": \"Navin\", \"first2\": \"Anita\", \"year\": \"2007\", \"title\": \"Understanding netball\", \"publisher\": \"Coachwise\", \"isbn\": \"978-1-905540-12-9\", \"oclc\": \"174094782\"}\nAt the beginning of every quarter and after a goal has been scored, play starts with a player in the centre position passing the ball from the centre of the court. These \"centre passes\" alternate between the teams, regardless of which team scored the last goal. When the umpire blows the whistle to restart play, four players from each team can move into the centre third to receive the pass. The centre pass must be caught or touched in the centre third.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"last1\": \"Shakespear\", \"first1\": \"Wilma\", \"last2\": \"Caldow\", \"first2\": \"Margaret\", \"year\": \"2009\", \"title\": \"Netball : steps to success\", \"location\": \"Champaign, Illinois\", \"publisher\": \"Human Kinetics\", \"isbn\": \"978-0-7360-7984-6\", \"oclc\": \"251227987\", \"ref\": \"harv\", \"urlaccess\": \"registration\"}{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"2009\", \"title\": \"Transforming Play: Teaching Tactics and Game Sense\", \"location\": \"Champaign, Illinois\", \"publisher\": \"Human Kinetics\", \"isbn\": \"978-0-7360-7518-3\", \"oclc\": \"423215335\", \"last\": \"Slade\", \"first\": \"Dennis\"} The ball is then moved up and down the court through passing and must be touched by a player in each adjacent third of the court.

If illegal contact is made, the player who contacted cannot participate in play until the player taking the penalty has passed or shot the ball.[54] If the ball is held in two hands and either dropped or a shot at goal is missed, the same player cannot be the first to touch it unless it first rebounds off the goal.[55]\n\nIndoor netball\nIndoor netball is a variation of netball, played exclusively indoors, in which the playing court is often surrounded on each side and overhead by a net. The net prevents the ball from leaving the court, permitting faster play by reducing playing stoppages.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"2003\", \"title\": \"The South African dictionary of sport\", \"publisher\": \"Spearhead\", \"isbn\": \"0-86486-535-X\", \"oclc\": \"249075345\", \"last\": \"Alswang\", \"first\": \"Joel\"}\nDifferent forms of indoor netball exist.
