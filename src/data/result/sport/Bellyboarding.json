In Hawaii people learnt the art of riding prone on these short wooden boards before they attempted to stand up on the longer \"alaia\" boards.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.originalsurfboards.co.uk/history.php\", \"title\": \"Archived copy\", \"accessdate\": \"2013-11-28\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20131120015540/http://www.originalsurfboards.co.uk/history.php\", \"archivedate\": \"2013-11-20\"}\nThe boards were made of Gaboon wood or of Paulownia wood.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.originalsurfboards.co.uk/history.php\", \"title\": \"Archived copy\", \"accessdate\": \"2013-11-28\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20131120015540/http://www.originalsurfboards.co.uk/history.php\", \"archivedate\": \"2013-11-20\"}\nIt appeared in the United Kingdom in the very early 1900s, especially in Cornwall and Devon on the English Channel. It was introduced to the United Kingdom by pioneering Perranporth watermen George Tamblyn and William Saunders, soldiers of WWI in 1918, having been inspired by stories from South African & Commonwealth soldiers they had met and swapped stories with in the trenches.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.bellyboarding.co.uk/\", \"title\": \"Archived copy\", \"accessdate\": \"2013-11-28\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20130821225858/http://www.bellyboarding.co.uk/\", \"archivedate\": \"2013-08-21\"}{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.originalsurfboards.co.uk/history.php\", \"title\": \"Archived copy\", \"accessdate\": \"2013-11-28\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20131120015540/http://www.originalsurfboards.co.uk/history.php\", \"archivedate\": \"2013-11-20\"}\nTom Tremewan, a relation of George Tamblyn, and the local undertaker, came up with the first bellyboard/surfboard in the UK, made out of coffin lids. These men became the first bellyboard riders of the UK, also known as coffin board/lid surfing.\nBellyboarding bloomed again after WWII as British soldiers returned home.  And by rich British people who travelled to Hawai and learned surf and decades later in the 1950s and 60s.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.bellyboarding.co.uk/\", \"title\": \"Archived copy\", \"accessdate\": \"2013-11-28\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20130821225858/http://www.bellyboarding.co.uk/\", \"archivedate\": \"2013-08-21\"}\nIt decreased with the development of bodyboard on polystyrene boards and of actual surfing.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.bellyboarding.co.uk/\", \"title\": \"Archived copy\", \"accessdate\": \"2013-11-28\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20130821225858/http://www.bellyboarding.co.uk/\", \"archivedate\": \"2013-08-21\"}{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.originalsurfboards.co.uk/history.php\", \"title\": \"Archived copy\", \"accessdate\": \"2013-11-28\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20131120015540/http://www.originalsurfboards.co.uk/history.php\", \"archivedate\": \"2013-11-20\"}\nThe World Bellyboard Championships, held each year at Chapel Porth in Cornwall, try to revive this sport. The first session took place in 2002 with 20 competitors. Some years later, there were more than 150 competitors also from Australia, USA and the British Virgin Islands.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.originalsurfboards.co.uk/history.php\", \"title\": \"Archived copy\", \"accessdate\": \"2013-11-28\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20131120015540/http://www.originalsurfboards.co.uk/history.php\", \"archivedate\": \"2013-11-20\"}\n\nMaterials\nGenerally, the board used in bellyboarding is a thin board of plywood. The nose of the board is up curved up. There are no swin fins. There is no leash because the board is easier to manage and to keep in hand.\nWetsuits are not necessary {\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.bellyboarding.co.uk/\", \"title\": \"Archived copy\", \"accessdate\": \"2013-11-28\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20130821225858/http://www.bellyboarding.co.uk/\", \"archivedate\": \"2013-08-21\"} because the skin is not irritated by the wood, as polystyrene of bodyboards do.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.originalsurfboards.co.uk/history.php\", \"title\": \"Archived copy\", \"accessdate\": \"2013-11-28\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20131120015540/http://www.originalsurfboards.co.uk/history.php\", \"archivedate\": \"2013-11-20\"}\n",
