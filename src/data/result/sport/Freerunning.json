{"url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freerunning", "content": "Freerunning\nFreerunning is a way of expression by interacting with various obstacles and environment. Freerunning may include flipping and spinning. These movements are usually adopted from other sports, such as gymnastics, tricking or breakdancing. Freerunners can create their own moves, flows and lines in different landscapes. It is all about becoming creative in an objective environment. Practitioners of freerunning usually do parkour as well. Freerunning is often associated with parkour by adding acrobatic and stylish moves, showcasing the art of movement. Freerunning was founded by Sebastien Foucan, who discussed the subject in Jump London in 2003.\nFoucan developed freerunning as a more inclusive form of parkour.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.wfpf.com/parkour/\", \"title\": \"What is Parkour?\", \"date\": \"2018\", \"work\": \"World Freerunning Parkour Federation\"} Parkour's efficient military style obstacle course training lends itself to martial art as a means of weapons avoidance and efficiently closing a distance to an opponent. Freerunning is derived from parkour, but it emphasizes not efficiency but artistry, allowing room for fancy flips and stylistic acrobatics.\n\nEtymology\nThe word \"freerunning\" was first used in the documentary, Jump London. The name came about because of a suggestion by Guillaume Pelletier (Origin of the FreeRunning), who was working with the group of practitioners at this time. In the documentary, freerunning was defined as an English translation of parkour.[3]\n\nPhilosophy\nThe central principle of freerunning is that one should express oneself by moving fluidly in one's environment; there are no limitations on the form of this movement.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"2008\", \"title\": \"Freerunning\", \"location\": \"U.K.\", \"publisher\": \"Michael O'Mara Books\", \"page\": \"8\", \"isbn\": \"978-1-56975-652-2\", \"last\": \"Foucan\", \"first\": \"Sebastien\", \"authorlink\": \"Sebastien Foucan\"} Foucan expands on a number of basic principles of the sport in his book, Freerunning.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"2008\", \"title\": \"Freerunning\", \"location\": \"U.K.\", \"publisher\": \"Michael O'Mara Books\", \"page\": \"8\", \"isbn\": \"978-1-56975-652-2\", \"last\": \"Foucan\", \"first\": \"Sebastien\", \"authorlink\": \"Sebastien Foucan\"} Other practitioners have suggested other principles. For example, Daniel Ilabaca encourages people to think positively, suggesting that practitioners of freerunning will sometimes fall\u2014largely because they think they might.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.beachcombermb.com/opinions/2012/01/27/parkour-legends-daniel-ilabaca-tim-shieff-and-oleg-vorslov/\", \"title\": \"Parkour Legends: Daniel Ilabaca, Tim Shieff and Oleg Vorslov\", \"date\": \"27 January 2012\", \"accessdate\": \"3 July 2013\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20130807001610/http://www.beachcombermb.com/opinions/2012/01/27/parkour-legends-daniel-ilabaca-tim-shieff-and-oleg-vorslov/\", \"author\": \"Declan Saldana\"}\n\nOrigins in parkour\nIn Western Europe, the idea of moving past obstacles for personal development or sport originated with Georges H\u00e9bert.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://parkourgenerations.com/article/parkour-history\", \"title\": \"Parkour History\", \"last\": \"Edwardes\", \"first\": \"Dan\", \"date\": \"22 August 2014\", \"work\": \"ParkourGenerations.com\"} He observed untrained native tribes in Africa with fantastic athletic ability and created the 'natural method' system to train people using the same ideas. His ideas eventually led to the parcours du combattant ('obstacle course', literally 'assault course'), which is now a standard of military training.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.urbanfreeflow.com/articles/methode_naturelle.htm\", \"title\": \"George H\\u00e9bert and the Natural Method of Physical Culture\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20050323090031/http://www.urbanfreeflow.com/articles/methode_naturelle.htm\", \"archivedate\": \"23 March 2005\"}\nThese ideas were picked up by a young Raymond Belle, who used them to practical effect while separated from his family during the First Indochina War. When he moved to France and started a family, he passed on these ideas to his son, David. 30 years later, other young people were attracted to these ideas and a small group formed, the Yamakasi, which included Foucan.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://parkourgenerations.com/article/parkour-history\", \"title\": \"Parkour History\", \"last\": \"Edwardes\", \"first\": \"Dan\", \"date\": \"22 August 2014\", \"work\": \"ParkourGenerations.com\"}{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"2009\", \"title\": \"Parkour\", \"publisher\": \"Intervista\", \"isbn\": \"978-2-35756-025-3\", \"last\": \"Belle\", \"first\": \"David\", \"authorlink\": \"David Belle\"} This group trained together for several years and in 1997, through David Belle's brother, Jean-Francois, they started to attract attention and be invited to perform at events. The Yamakasi eventually split apart, though, because some members sought to find more individual expressions of the discipline.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"2011\", \"title\": \"Cin\\u00e9 Parkour\", \"isbn\": \"978-0-9569717-1-5\", \"last\": \"Angel\", \"first\": \"Julie\"}[10]\nMeanwhile, action star Jackie Chan had also been heavily featuring the same concepts in most of his films ever since the early 1980s from the other side of the globe.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.parkourfreerunningonline.com/jackie-chans-special-style-of-parkour/\", \"title\": \"Jackie Chan's Special Style Of Parkour\", \"date\": \"November 5, 2015\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20160304081600/http://www.parkourfreerunningonline.com/jackie-chans-special-style-of-parkour/\", \"archivedate\": \"2016-03-04\"}\n\nFurther development\nFoucan wanted to create a discipline that was more personal to the individual than parkour and more easily adapted to suit each person's individual goals.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"2008\", \"title\": \"Freerunning\", \"location\": \"U.K.\", \"publisher\": \"Michael O'Mara Books\", \"page\": \"8\", \"isbn\": \"978-1-56975-652-2\", \"last\": \"Foucan\", \"first\": \"Sebastien\", \"authorlink\": \"Sebastien Foucan\"} His idea was similar to that of Bruce Lee's creation of Jeet Kune Do. Foucan wanted to take everything that he had found useful and that he liked from his parkour experiences and combine it into one sport.[12]\nFoucan's early ideas were first spread through the Jump London documentary (2003) and its sequel, Jump Britain (2005). Foucan has appeared in other productions, such as Casino Royale and Madonna's Confessions Tour.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"2011\", \"title\": \"Cin\\u00e9 Parkour\", \"isbn\": \"978-0-9569717-1-5\", \"last\": \"Angel\", \"first\": \"Julie\"} With each appearance both the discipline and Foucan himself increased in fame.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"2008\", \"title\": \"Freerunning\", \"location\": \"U.K.\", \"publisher\": \"Michael O'Mara Books\", \"page\": \"8\", \"isbn\": \"978-1-56975-652-2\", \"last\": \"Foucan\", \"first\": \"Sebastien\", \"authorlink\": \"Sebastien Foucan\"}\n\nInternational\nIn 2014, the BBC traveled to J&K\nKashmir{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-30347099/\", \"title\": \"Kashmir Freerunning Finding Freedom in the Art of Parkour\", \"work\": \"BBC\"} to highlight the youth partaking in freerunning as a form of freedom of expression.\n"}
