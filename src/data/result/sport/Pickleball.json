The sport shares features of other racquet sports:   the dimensions and layout of a badminton court, and a net and rules somewhat similar to tennis, with several modifications. Pickleball was invented in the mid 1960s as a children's backyard game.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"2015-10-21\", \"title\": \"Food for Thought:The Evolution and Growth of Pickleball\", \"url\": \"http://www.tennis.com/your-game/2015/10/food-thought-evolution-and-growth-pickleball/56634/\", \"work\": \"Tennis.com\", \"publisher\": \"The Tennis Media Company\", \"last\": \"Kane\", \"first\": \"David\"}\n\nHistory\nThe game started during the summer of 1965 on Bainbridge Island, Washington, at the home of Joel Pritchard, who later served in Congress and as  lieutenant governor.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"August 24, 1990\", \"title\": \"Pickle-ball: Founders of game say paddle sport simply is a barrel of fun\", \"url\": \"https://archive.seattletimes.com/archive/?date=19900824&slug=1089412\", \"work\": \"[[The Seattle Times]]\", \"page\": \"C7\", \"last\": \"Lyons\", \"first\": \"Gil\"} He and two of his friends, Bill Bell and Barney McCallum, returned from golf and found their families bored one Saturday afternoon. They attempted to set up badminton, but no one could find the shuttlecock. They improvised with a Wiffle ball, lowered the badminton net, and fabricated paddles of plywood from a nearby shed.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"title\": \"Origins of Pickleball\", \"url\": \"http://www.newsandsentinel.com/page/content.detail/id/507610.html?nav=5055\", \"work\": \"The Parkersburg News and Sentinel\", \"first\": \"Joan\", \"last\": \"Pritchard\"}{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://pickleball.com/pages/history\", \"title\": \"How Pickle-ball Came to Be\", \"publisher\": \"Pickleball Inc.\", \"work\": \"The Official Pickleball Website\"}{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.hoffmanestatespickleball.com/the-history-of-pickleball.html\", \"title\": \"The History of Pickleball\", \"publisher\": \"Hoffman Estates Pickleball\", \"accessdate\": \"March 1, 2014\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20120322085100/http://www.newsandsentinel.com/page/content.detail/id/507610.html?nav=5055\"}\nMcCallum made the first paddles that were specifically for paddleball on his basement bandsaw.  He tried several alternative paddles, but one he called \u201cM2\u201d become the paddle of choice for most players.[8]  In 1972, McCallum incorporated Pickle-Ball, Inc. and manufactured wooden paddles to help grow the sport. His son David McCallum now runs the business, which is headquartered in Kent, Washington.[9]\nSome sources claim that the name \"Pickleball\" was derived from that of the Pritchard's family dog, Pickles, or from the term \"pickle boat\".{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"title\": \"Origins of Pickleball\", \"url\": \"http://www.newsandsentinel.com/page/content.detail/id/507610.html?nav=5055\", \"work\": \"The Parkersburg News and Sentinel\", \"first\": \"Joan\", \"last\": \"Pritchard\"}{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.hoffmanestatespickleball.com/the-history-of-pickleball.html\", \"title\": \"The History of Pickleball\", \"publisher\": \"Hoffman Estates Pickleball\", \"accessdate\": \"March 1, 2014\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20120322085100/http://www.newsandsentinel.com/page/content.detail/id/507610.html?nav=5055\"} According to Joan Pritchard, Joel Pritchard's wife, \u201cThe name of the game became Pickle Ball, after I said it reminded me of the Pickle Boat in crew where oarsmen were chosen from the leftovers of other boats. Somehow the idea the name came from our dog Pickles was attached to the naming of the game, but Pickles wasn\u2019t on the scene for two more years. The dog was named for the game, but stories about the name\u2019s origin were funnier thinking the game was named for the dog.\"{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.usapa.org/history-of-the-game/\", \"title\": \"History of the Game\", \"publisher\": \"Official USAPA Website\"}\n\nCourt\nThe pickleball court{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://thepickleballpaddle.com/pickleball-court-dimensions/\", \"title\": \"All About Pickleball Court Dimensions\", \"publisher\": \"The Pickleball Paddle Inc.\", \"accessdate\": \"June 11, 2018\", \"work\": \"The Pickleball Paddle USA Website\"} is similar to a doubles badminton court. The actual size of the court is 20 by 44 feet for both doubles and singles. The net is hung at 36 inches on the ends, and 34 inches at center. The court is striped like a tennis court, with no alleys; but the outer courts, and not the inner courts, are divided in half by service lines. The inner courts are non-volley zones and extend 7 feet from the net on either side.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"title\": \"The Art of Pickleball\", \"edition\": \"4th\", \"publisher\": \"Two Cats Press\", \"last\": \"Leach\", \"first\": \"Gale H.\"}\n\nPlay\nThe ball is served{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://reviewscon.com/pickleball-serves/\", \"title\": \"How to Serve a Pickleball and Types of Best Pickleball Serves\", \"last\": \"Allen\", \"first\": \"Henry\", \"date\": \"2019-05-19\", \"website\": \"ReviewsCon\", \"language\": \"en-US\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20190608141818/https://reviewscon.com/pickleball-serves/\", \"archivedate\": \"2019-06-08\"} with an underarm stroke so that contact with the ball is made below waist level (waist is defined as the navel level) in an upward arc. The server hits from behind the baseline on one side of the center line and aims diagonally to the opponent's service court (as in the figure on the right).\nOnly the serving side may score a point. Play ends for a point when one side commits a fault.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://indoored.com/pickleball/\", \"title\": \"Pickleball Guide\", \"publisher\": \"Indoored Inc.\", \"work\": \"Indoored.com\"}  Faults include:\nA player may enter the non-volley zone to play a ball that bounces and may stay there to play balls that bounce.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"title\": \"The Art of Pickleball\", \"edition\": \"4th\", \"publisher\": \"Two Cats Press\", \"last\": \"Leach\", \"first\": \"Gale H.\"}:A-22 The player must exit the non-volley zone before playing a volley.\nThe first side scoring 11 points leading by at least two points wins the game.  If the two sides are tied at 10 points apiece, the side that goes ahead by two points wins the game.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.pickleball.com/rules-how-to-play-pickleball-s/106.htm\", \"title\": \"How to Play the Game\", \"publisher\": \"Pickleball Inc.\", \"work\": \"The Official Pickleball Website\"}\nTournament games may be played to 11, 15 or 21 points with players rotating sides at 6, 8 or 11 total points respectively.\nThe server or server and partner usually stay at the baseline until the first return has been hit back and bounced once.\nAt the beginning of a doubles game before any serving, the score is 0\u20130.  Then the side serving first gets only one fault before their side is out, meaning that their opponents serve next. After the first fault each side gets 2 faults (one for each team member serving) before their side is \"out\".\nIn singles play, each side gets only one fault before a side out and the opponent then serves. The server's score will always be even (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10...) when serving from the right side, and odd (1, 3, 5, 7, 9...) when serving from the left side.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"title\": \"The Art of Pickleball\", \"edition\": \"4th\", \"publisher\": \"Two Cats Press\", \"last\": \"Leach\", \"first\": \"Gale H.\"}:A-15\nPara-Pickleball, or wheel chair pickleball, was officially recognized as a competitive branch of Pickleball by the United States of America Pickleball Association in 2016.  Rules for those in wheelchairs are similar to the standing rules with minor alternatives.  The player's wheelchair is considered to be part of the player's body and all applicable rules that usually apply to the body will also apply to the player's wheelchair.  A pickleball player in a wheelchair is allowed two bounces instead of the one a standup player would receive. When a player in a wheelchair is serving the ball, they must be in a stationary position.  They are then allowed one push before striking the ball for service.  When the player strikes the ball, the wheels of the wheel chair shall not touch any baselines, sidelines, center lines or the extended center or sidelines. When there is a mixed game of those in wheelchairs and those standing, the applicable rules apply for those players respectively.  Standing players will adhere to the standing pickleball rules and the wheelchair players will adhere to the wheelchair pickleball rules.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.usapa.org/docs/ifp/USAPA-Rulebook.pdf\", \"title\": \"Official Tournament Rulebook\", \"date\": \"2018\", \"publisher\": \"International Federation of Pickleball\"}\n",
