    "content": "Zorbing\nZorbing (also known as globe-riding, sphereing, orbing) is the recreation or sport of rolling downhill inside an orb, typically made of transparent plastic.[1] Zorbing is generally performed on a gentle slope but can also be done on a level surface, permitting more rider control. In the absence of hills, some operators have constructed inflatable, wooden, or metal ramps. Due to the buoyant nature of the orbs, Zorbing can also be carried out on water, provided the orb is inflated properly and sealed once the rider is inside. \"Water walking\" using such orbs has become popular in theme parks across the UK.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncHSmCXErI0\", \"title\": \"Noah in Aqua Zorb, Chessington 25June12\", \"last\": \"bersmythuk\", \"date\": \"25 June 2012\", \"via\": \"YouTube\"}[failed verification]\nThere are two types of orbs: harnessed and non-harnessed. Non-harnessed orbs carry up to three riders, while the harnessed orbs are constructed for one to two riders. The first zorbing site was established in Rotorua, New Zealand, by ZORB Ltd.[3]\n\nHistory\nA Russian article on the Zorb mentions a similar device having debuted in 1973.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.gillesebersolt.com/tel/ballulegb.pdf\", \"title\": \"A History of the Ballule\", \"last\": \"Ebersolt\", \"first\": \"Gilles\", \"date\": \"April 2008\", \"format\": \"PDF\", \"accessdate\": \"August 18, 2009\"} In the early 1980s, the Dangerous Sports Club constructed a giant sphere (reportedly 23 metres or 75 feet across) with a gimbal arrangement supporting two deck chairs inside. This device was eventually cut up for scrap.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.extremedreams.co.uk/index.php/Extremedreams/zorb/xsid/59\", \"title\": \"What on earth is a zorb?\", \"publisher\": \"ExtremeDreams\", \"accessdate\": \"August 18, 2009\"} Human spheres have been depicted in mass media since 1990 when the Gladiators event \"Atlaspheres\" first aired, albeit with steel balls.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mI7vz9Bd664\", \"title\": \"Operation Condor - Zorb ball scene - YouTube\", \"date\": \"2007-01-19\", \"accessdate\": \"2016-06-20\"}\nIn 1994, three investors created the firm ZORB Limited in New Zealand to create suitable spheres for humans and to commercialize sphereing.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"last1\": \"READ\", \"first1\": \"ELLEN\", \"date\": \"14 Aug 2003\", \"title\": \"Zorb inventors rolling in it\", \"url\": \"https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&objectid=3518104\", \"issue\": \"14 Aug 2003\", \"publisher\": \"New Zealand Herald\", \"accessdate\": \"11 July 2019\"} Their business model was to develop the activity via a franchise system. Zorbing entered the Concise Oxford English Dictionary in 2001 where it was defined as: \"a sport in which a participant is secured inside an inner capsule in a large, transparent ball which is then rolled along the ground or down hills\".\n\nConstruction\nThe orb is double-sectioned, with one ball inside the other with an air layer in between (unlike the water walking ball, which is usually a single thin-walled ball). This acts as a shock absorber for the rider. Orbs are lightweight and made of flexible plastic. Many orbs have straps to hold the rider in place, while others leave the rider free to walk the orb around or be tossed about freely by the rolling motion. A typical orb is about 3 metres (10\u00a0ft) in diameter with an inner orb size of about 2 metres (6\u00a0ft 7\u00a0in), leaving a 50\u201360\u00a0centimetre (20\u201324\u00a0in) air cushion around the riders.  The plastic is approximately 0.8 millimetres (0.03\u00a0in) thick.[citation needed] The inner and outer orbs are connected by small nylon strings. Orbs have one or two tunnel-like entrances.\n\nFacilities\n'Hill-Rolling' or 'Globe riding' are generic names for this activity which is practised in the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Sweden, Estonia, Canada, the Czech Republic, Poland, the Slovak Republic, Switzerland, Japan, Kochi in India, Phuket in Thailand, and Slovenia.[citation needed] In the United States, there are facilities in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, Amesbury, Massachusetts, and Roundtop Mountain Resort, Lewisberry and Pennsylvania.[citation needed]\n\nRecords\nThe Guinness Book of World Records recognises four sphereing records:\n\nInjuries and deaths\nAlthough the cushioning design of the orbs prevents many serious injuries, light injuries such as bruises and grazes can often be sustained by colliding with objects or tripping whilst the orb is rolling down an incline. Even though severe injury is rare, there have been cases of children passing out due to lack of air and even some deaths. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission has urged consumers to stop using water walking balls \"due to the potential risks of suffocation and drowning\" and reports that several states have banned their use.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.cpsc.gov/en/Newsroom/News-Releases/2011/Consumer-Alert-CPSC-Warns-of-Deadly-Danger-with-Water-Walking-Balls/\", \"title\": \"Consumer Alert: CPSC Warns of Deadly Danger with Water Walking Balls\", \"publisher\": \"U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission\", \"accessdate\": \"1 March 2016\"}\nIn June 2009, a teacher died, and a pupil was severely injured in the Czech Republic while trying zorbing.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"June 5, 2009\", \"title\": \"Teacher killed in zorbing accident\", \"url\": \"http://www.news.com.au/top-stories/teacher-killed-in-zorbing-accident/story-e6frfkp9-1225722279320\", \"work\": \"News.com.au\"}\nIn January 2013 at a ski resort in Dombay, Russia, a man died from a broken neck, and another was badly injured when the Zorb he was in rolled out of control down a mountain, hitting rocks and eventually coming to a stop a kilometre away on a frozen lake.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"January 9, 2013\", \"title\": \"'Zorbing' Death Brings Call For Safety Rules; Fatal Ride Captured On Video\", \"url\": \"https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/01/09/168943032/zorbing-death-brings-call-for-safety-rules-fatal-ride-captured-on-video\", \"work\": \"[[NPR]]\"}{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"January 9, 2013\", \"title\": \"Fatal Zorb accident at ski resort\", \"url\": \"http://www.3news.co.nz/VIDEO-Zorb-death-at-Russian-ski-resort/tabid/313/articleID/282433/Default.aspx\", \"work\": \"3 News NZ\"}{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"January 11, 2013\", \"title\": \"Man in Plastic Ball Dies on Russian Ski Slope\", \"url\": \"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/11/world/europe/zorbing-accident-kills-1-man-and-injures-another-in-russia.html\", \"work\": \"[[New York Times]]\"}  The incident was caught on camera and uploaded to the Internet.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"January 4, 2013\", \"title\": \"VIDEO: Zorb death at Russian ski resort\", \"url\": \"https://www.mreporter.ru/reports/125474\", \"work\": \"Mobile Reporter (RU)\"} After the incident made international headlines, Russian authorities called for tougher safety laws.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"January 10, 2012\", \"title\": \"Russia probes Zorb death\", \"url\": \"http://www.3news.co.nz/Russia-probes-Zorb-death/tabid/417/articleID/282548/Default.aspx\", \"work\": \"3 News NZ\"}\n\nReferences\n\n",
