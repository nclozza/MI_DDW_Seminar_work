In most cases, the parents did not have the option to marry to remove that status, as incestuous marriages were, and are, normally also prohibited.\nA common justification for prohibiting incest is avoiding inbreeding: a collection of genetic disorders suffered by the children of parents with a close genetic relationship.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"last2\": \"Durham\", \"first2\": \"William H.\", \"year\": \"2004\", \"title\": \"Inbreeding, Incest, and the Incest Taboo: The State of Knowledge at the Turn of the Century\", \"url\": \"https://books.google.com/books?id=OW1nuQxcIQgC&pg=PA3\", \"publisher\": \"Stanford University Press\", \"page\": \"3\", \"first\": \"Arthur P.\", \"last\": \"Wolf\"} Such children are at greater risk for congenital disorders, death, and developmental and physical disability, and that risk is proportional to their parents' coefficient of relationship\u2014a measure of how closely the parents are related genetically.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"last2\": \"Durham\", \"first2\": \"William H.\", \"year\": \"2004\", \"title\": \"Inbreeding, Incest, and the Incest Taboo: The State of Knowledge at the Turn of the Century\", \"url\": \"https://books.google.com/books?id=OW1nuQxcIQgC&pg=PA3\", \"publisher\": \"Stanford University Press\", \"page\": \"3\", \"first\": \"Arthur P.\", \"last\": \"Wolf\"}{\"citetype\": \"journal\", \"last1\": \"Fareed\", \"first1\": \"M\", \"last2\": \"Afzal\", \"first2\": \"M\", \"year\": \"2014\", \"title\": \"Estimating the inbreeding depression on cognitive behavior: A population based study of child cohort\", \"journal\": \"PLoS ONE\", \"volume\": \"9\", \"issue\": \"10\", \"page\": \"e109585\", \"doi\": \"10.1371/journal.pone.0109585\", \"pmc\": \"4196914\", \"pmid\": \"25313490\"} But cultural anthropologists have noted that inbreeding avoidance cannot form the sole basis for the incest taboo because the boundaries of the incest prohibition vary widely between cultures, and not necessarily in ways that maximize the avoidance of inbreeding.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"last2\": \"Durham\", \"first2\": \"William H.\", \"year\": \"2004\", \"title\": \"Inbreeding, Incest, and the Incest Taboo: The State of Knowledge at the Turn of the Century\", \"url\": \"https://books.google.com/books?id=OW1nuQxcIQgC&pg=PA3\", \"publisher\": \"Stanford University Press\", \"page\": \"3\", \"first\": \"Arthur P.\", \"last\": \"Wolf\"}{\"citetype\": \"journal\", \"last1 \": \"Schneider\", \"first1 \": \"D.

Several scholars, such as Frier et al., state that sibling marriages were widespread among all classes in Egypt during the Graeco-Roman period. Numerous papyri and the Roman census declarations attest to many husbands and wives being brother and sister, of the same father and mother.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"title\": \"Life in Egypt under Roman Rule\", \"publisher\": \"[[Oxford University Press|Clarendon Press]]\", \"isbn\": \"978-0-19-814848-7\", \"last\": \"Lewis\", \"first\": \"N.\"}{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"last2\": \"Bagnall\", \"first2\": \"Roger S.\", \"year\": \"1994\", \"title\": \"The Demography of Roman Egypt\", \"location\": \"Cambridge, UK\", \"publisher\": \"[[Cambridge University Press]]\", \"last\": \"Frier\", \"first\": \"Bruce W.\", \"author2link\": \"Roger S.

In the \"sequel\" to Oedipus, Antigone, his four children are also punished for their parents' incestuousness. Incest appears in the commonly accepted version of the birth of Adonis, when his mother, Myrrha has sex with her father Cinyras during a festival, disguised as a prostitute.\nIn Ancient Greece, Spartan King Leonidas I, hero of the legendary Battle of Thermopylae, was married to his niece Gorgo, daughter of his half-brother Cleomenes I. Greek law allowed marriage between a brother and sister if they had different mothers. For example, some accounts say that Elpinice was for a time married to her half-brother Cimon.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/Bios/Elpinice.html\", \"title\": \"Elpinice\", \"last\": \"Lahanas\", \"first\": \"Michael\", \"year\": \"2006\", \"publisher\": \"Hellenica\", \"accessdate\": \"2009-06-06\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20090921025414/http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/Bios/Elpinice.html\", \"work\": \"Hellenic World encyclopaedia\"}\nIncest is mentioned and condemned in Virgil's Aeneid Book VI:[40] hic thalamum invasit natae vetitosque hymenaeos; \"This one invaded a daughter's room and a forbidden sex act\".\nRoman civil law prohibited marriages within four degrees of consanguinity[41] but had no degrees of affinity with regards to marriage. Roman civil laws prohibited any marriage between parents and children, either in the ascending or descending line ad infinitum.[41] Adoption was considered the same as affinity in that an adoptive father could not marry an unemancipated daughter or granddaughter even if the adoption had been dissolved.[41] Incestuous unions were discouraged and considered nefas (against the laws of gods and man) in ancient Rome. In AD 295 incest was explicitly forbidden by an imperial edict, which divided the concept of incestus into two categories of unequal gravity: the incestus iuris gentium, which was applied to both Romans and non-Romans in the Empire, and the incestus iuris civilis, which concerned only Roman citizens. Therefore, for example, an Egyptian could marry an aunt, but a Roman could not. Despite the act of incest being unacceptable within the Roman Empire, Roman Emperor Caligula is rumored to have had sexual relationships with all three of his sisters (Julia Livilla, Drusilla, and Agrippina the Younger).{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"2007\", \"title\": \"Emperors of Rome\", \"location\": \"Englewood Cliffs, N.J\", \"publisher\": \"Quercus\", \"isbn\": \"978-1-84724-166-5\", \"last\": \"Potter\", \"first\": \"David Morris\"} Emperor Claudius, after executing his previous wife, married his brother's daughter Agrippina the Younger, and changed the law to allow an otherwise illegal union.[43] The law prohibiting marrying a sister's daughter remained.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"2002\", \"title\": \"Women and the Law in the Roman Empire: a Sourcebook on Marriage, Divorce and Widowhood\", \"url\": \"https://books.google.com/books?id=4X8HXDwMHawC&pg=PA137\", \"publisher\": \"Psychology Press\", \"isbn\": \"978-0-415-15240-2\", \"accessdate\": \"7 November 2011\", \"first\": \"Judith Evans\", \"last\": \"Grubbs\"} The taboo against incest in Ancient Rome is demonstrated by the fact that politicians would use charges of incest (often false charges) as insults and means of political disenfranchisement.\nIn Norse mythology, there are themes of brother-sister marriage, a prominent example being between Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r and his unnamed sister (perhaps Nerthus), parents of Freyja and Freyr. Loki in turn also accuses Freyja and Freyr of having a sexual relationship.\n\nBiblical references\nThe earliest Biblical reference to incest involved Cain.

This was especially true in the Habsburg, Hohenzollern, Savoy and Bourbon royal houses. However, relations between siblings, which may have been tolerated in other cultures, were considered abhorrent. For example, the accusation that Anne Boleyn and her brother George Boleyn had committed incest was one of the reasons that both siblings were executed in May 1536.\nIncestuous marriages were also seen in the royal houses of ancient Japan and Korea,[52] Inca Peru, Ancient Hawaii, and, at times, Central Africa, Mexico, and Thailand.[53] Like the pharaohs of ancient Egypt, the Inca rulers married their sisters. Huayna Capac, for instance, was the son of Topa Inca Yupanqui and the Inca's sister and wife.[54]\nHalf-sibling marriages were found in ancient Japan such as the marriage of Emperor Bidatsu and his half-sister Empress Suiko.[55] Japanese Prince Kinashi no Karu had sexual relationships with his full sister Princess Karu no \u014ciratsume, although the action was regarded as foolish.[56] In order to prevent the influence of the other families, a half-sister of Korean Goryeo Dynasty monarch Gwangjong became his wife in the 10th century. Her name was Daemok.[57] Marriage with a family member not related by blood was also regarded as contravening morality and was therefore incest. One example of this is the 14th century Chunghye of Goryeo, who raped one of his deceased father's concubines, who was thus regarded to be his mother.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"2017\", \"title\": \"Hont\\u014dni hisan'na Ch\\u014dsen-shi 'k\\u014draishisetsuy\\u014d' o yomi kai \\u672c\\u5f53\\u306b\\u60b2\\u60e8\\u306a\\u671d\\u9bae\\u53f2 \\u300c\\u9ad8\\u9e97\\u53f2\\u7bc0\\u8981\\u300d\\u3092\\u8aad\\u307f\\u89e3\\u304f\", \"publisher\": \"KADOKAWA\", \"isbn\": \"978-4-04-082109-2\", \"author\": \"Asogawa Shizuo \\u9ebb\\u751f\\u5ddd\\u9759\\u7537\"}\nIn India, the largest proportion of women aged 13 to 49 who marry their close relative are in Tamil Nadu, then Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Maharashtra.

Because of violent behavior on the part of his father, Patrick was taken in at the age of 3 by foster parents, who adopted him later. At the age of 23 he learned about his biological parents, contacted his mother, and met her and his then 16-year-old sister Susan for the first time. The now-adult Patrick moved in with his birth family shortly thereafter. After their mother died suddenly six months later, the siblings became intimately close, and had their first child together in 2001. By 2004, they had four children together: Eric, Sarah, Nancy, and Sofia. The public nature of their relationship, and the repeated prosecutions and even jail time they have served as a result, has caused some in Germany to question whether incest between consenting adults should be punished at all. An article about them in Der Spiegel states that the couple are happy together. According to court records, the first three children have mental and physical disabilities, and have been placed in foster care.[4] In April 2012, at the European Court of Human Rights, Patrick St\u00fcbing lost his case that the conviction violated his right to a private and family life.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.cnn.com/2012/04/13/world/europe/germany-incest-court/index.html?hpt=hp_bn2\", \"title\": \"German incest couple lose European court case - CNN\", \"last\": \"Staff\", \"first\": \"By the CNN Wire\"}[123] On September 24, 2014, the German Ethics Council has recommended that the government abolish laws criminalizing incest between siblings, arguing that such bans impinge upon citizens.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.thedailybeast.com/cheats/2014/09/24/german-ethics-council-incest-is-a-right.html\", \"title\": \"German Ethics Council: Incest Is a Right\", \"date\": \"2014-09-24\", \"website\": \"The Daily Beast\"}{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"2014-09-24\", \"title\": \"Incest a 'fundamental right', German committee says\", \"url\": \"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/11119062/Incest-a-fundamental-right-German-committee-says.html\", \"newspaper\": \"The Telegraph\"}\nSome societies differentiate between full sibling and half sibling relations.

In light of this law being held unconstitutional, South Korea now only prohibits up to third cousins (see Article 809 of the Korean Civil Code).

For example, the question of the legality and morality of a widower who wished to marry his deceased wife's sister was the subject of long and fierce debate in the United Kingdom in the 19th century, involving, among others, Matthew Boulton{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"2003\", \"title\": \"Incest and the English Novel, 1684\\u20131814\", \"location\": \"Baltimore MD\", \"publisher\": \"Johns Hopkins University Press\", \"page\": \"38\", \"last\": \"Pollak\", \"first\": \"Ellen\"}{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"date\": \"May 2007\", \"chapter\": \"Boulton, Matthew (1728\\u20131809)\", \"title\": \"Oxford Dictionary of National Biography\", \"location\": \"Oxford, England\", \"publisher\": \"Oxford University Press\", \"last\": \"Tann\", \"first\": \"Jennifer\"} and Charles La Trobe. The marriages were entered into in Scotland and Switzerland respectively, where they were legal. In medieval Europe, standing as a godparent to a child also created a bond of affinity.[citation needed] But in other societies, a deceased spouse's sibling was considered the ideal person to marry. The Hebrew Bible forbids a man from marrying his brother's widow with the exception that, if his brother died childless, the man is instead required to marry his brother's widow so as to \"raise up seed to him\" (per Deuteronomy 25:5\u20136).  Some societies have long practiced sororal polygyny, a form of polygamy in which a man marries multiple wives who are sisters to each other (though not closely related to him).\nIn Islamic law, marriage among close blood relations like parents, stepparent, parents in-law, siblings, stepsiblings, the children of siblings, aunts and uncles is prohibited, while first or second cousins may marry. Marrying the widow of a brother, or the sister of deceased or divorced wife is also allowed.\n\nInbreeding\nOffspring of biologically related parents are subject to the possible impact of inbreeding. Such offspring have a higher possibility of congenital birth defects (see Coefficient of relationship) because it increases the proportion of zygotes that are homozygous for deleterious recessive alleles that produce such disorders{\"citetype\": \"journal\", \"year\": \"1969\", \"title\": \"Genetics, Ecology, and the Origins of Incest and Exogamy\", \"journal\": \"Current Anthropology\", \"volume\": \"10\", \"pages\": \"45\\u201362\", \"last\": \"Livingstone\", \"first\": \"F. B.\"} (see Inbreeding depression). Because most such alleles are rare in populations, it is unlikely that two unrelated marriage partners will both be heterozygous carriers. However, because close relatives share a large fraction of their alleles, the probability that any such rare deleterious allele present in the common ancestor will be inherited from both related parents is increased dramatically with respect to non-inbred couples. Contrary to common belief, inbreeding does not in itself alter allele frequencies, but rather increases the relative proportion of homozygotes to heterozygotes. This has two contrary effects.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"1993\", \"title\": \"The Natural History of Inbreeding and Outbreeding: Theoretical and Empirical Perspectives\", \"location\": \"Chicago\", \"publisher\": \"[[University of Chicago Press]]\", \"isbn\": \"978-0-226-79854-7\", \"last\": \"Thornhill\", \"first\": \"Nancy Wilmsen\"}\nThe closer two persons are related, the higher the zygosity, and thus the more severe the biological costs of inbreeding.

Prohibition of incest laws may extend to restrictions on marriage rights, which also vary between jurisdictions. Most jurisdictions prohibit parent-child and sibling marriages, while others also prohibit first-cousin and uncle-niece and aunt-nephew marriages. In most places, incest is illegal, regardless of the ages of the two partners. In other countries, incestuous relationships between consenting adults (with the age varying by location) are permitted, including in the Netherlands, France, Slovenia and Spain. Sweden is the only country that allows marriage between half-siblings and they must seek government counseling before marriage.[145]\nWhile the legality of consensual incest varies by country, sexual assault committed against a relative is usually seen as a very serious crime. In some legal systems, the fact of a perpetrator being a close relative to the victim constitutes an aggravating circumstance in the case of sexual crimes such as rape and sexual conduct with a minor \u2013 this is the case in Romania.[146]\n\nJewish\nAccording to the Torah, per Leviticus 18, \"the children of Israel\"\u2014Israelite men and women alike\u2014are forbidden from sexual relations between people who are \"near of kin\" (verse 6), who are defined as:\nAnd Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of the LORD, saying: 'The tribe of the sons of Joseph speaketh right. This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying: Let them be married to whom they think best; only into the family of the tribe of their father shall they be married. So shall no inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe; for the children of Israel shall cleave every one to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers. And every daughter, that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel, shall be wife unto one of the family of the tribe of her father, that the children of Israel may possess every man the inheritance of his fathers. So shall no inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe; for the tribes of the children of Israel shall cleave each one to its own inheritance.' Even as the LORD commanded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad. For Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married unto their father's brothers' sons. (Leviticus 18:12\u201314)Incestuous relationships are considered so severe among chillulim HaShem, acts which bring shame to the name of God, as to be, along with the other forbidden relationships that are mentioned in Leviticus 18, punishable by death as specified in Leviticus 20.\nIn the 4th century BCE, the Soferim (scribes) declared that there were relationships within which marriage constituted incest, in addition to those mentioned by the Torah. These additional relationships were termed seconds (Hebrew: sheniyyot), and included the wives of a man's grandfather and grandson.[148] The classical rabbis prohibited marriage between a man and any of these seconds of his, on the basis that doing so would act as a safeguard against infringing the biblical incest rules,[149] although there was inconclusive debate about exactly what the limits should be for the definition of seconds.[150]\nMarriages that are forbidden in the Torah (with the exception of uncle-niece marriages) were regarded by the rabbis of the Middle Ages as invalid \u2013 as if they had never occurred;[151] any children born to such a couple were regarded as bastards under Jewish law,[151] and the relatives of the spouse were not regarded as forbidden relations for a further marriage.[152] On the other hand, those relationships which were prohibited due to qualifying as seconds, and so forth, were regarded as wicked, but still valid;[151] while they might have pressured such a couple to divorce, any children of the union were still seen as legitimate.[151]\n\nChristian\nThe Catholic Church regards incest as a sin against the Sacrament of Matrimony.[153] For the Catholic Church, at the heart of the immorality of incest is the corruption and disordering of proper family relations. These disordered relationships take on a particularly grave and immoral character when it becomes child sexual abuse. \n\nAs the Catechism of the Catholic Church says: 2388 Incest designates intimate relations between relatives or in-laws within a degree that prohibits marriage between them. St. Paul stigmatizes this especially grave offense: 'It is actually reported that there is immorality among you...for a man is living with his father's wife....In the name of the Lord Jesus...you are to deliver this man to Satan for the destruction of the flesh....' Incest corrupts family relationships and marks a regression toward animality.\n2389  Connected to incest is any sexual abuse perpetrated by adults on children or adolescents entrusted to their care. The offense is compounded by the scandalous harm done to the physical and moral integrity of the young, who will remain scarred by it all their lives; and the violation of responsibility for their upbringing.[154]The Book of Common Prayer of the Anglican Communion allows marriages up to and including first cousins.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"1962\", \"chapter\": \"A Table of Kindred and Affinity\", \"title\": \"Book of Common Prayer\", \"url\": \"http://prayerbook.ca/resources/bcponline/\", \"place\": \"Canada\"}\n\nIslamic\nThe Quran gives specific rules regarding incest, which prohibit a man from marrying or having sexual relationships with:\nCousin marriage finds support in Islamic scriptures and is widespread in the Middle East.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"last1\": \"Inhorn\", \"first1\": \"Marcia C.\", \"last2\": \"Chavkin\", \"first2\": \"Wendy\", \"date\": \"2014\", \"title\": \"Globalized Fatherhood\", \"location\": \"New York City\", \"publisher\": \"Berghahn Books\", \"page\": \"245\", \"isbn\": \"9781782384380\", \"first3\": \"Jos\\u00e9-Alberto\", \"last3\": \"Navarro\"}\nAlthough Islam allows cousin marriage,  there are Hadiths attributed to Muhammad calling for distance from the marriage of relatives.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://seekershub.org/ans-blog/2011/10/07/did-the-prophet-peace-be-upon-him-discourage-marrying-cousins/\", \"title\": \"Did the Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) Discourage Marrying Cousins? - SeekersHub Answers\", \"website\": \"SeekersHub Answers\", \"accessdate\": \"12 August 2017\", \"author1\": \"Shaykh Faraz A.

There is a lack of genealogies and census material on the frequency of Xvaetvadatha.[170][171] Evidence from Dura-Europos, however, combined with that of the Jewish and Christian sources citing actual cases under the Sasanians, strengthen the evidence of the Zoroastrian texts.

Hindus believe there are both karmic and practical bad effects of incest and thus practice strict rules of both endogamy and exogamy, in relation to the family tree (gotra) or bloodline (Pravara).\nMarriage within the gotra (swagotra marriages) are banned under the rule of exogamy in the traditional matrimonial system.[177] People within the gotra are regarded as kin and marrying such a person would be thought of as incest. Marriage with paternal cousins (a form of parallel-cousin relationship) is strictly prohibited.\nAlthough generally marriages between persons having the same gotra are prohibited,[178] how this is defined may vary regionally.\nDepending on culture and caste of the population in the region, marriage may be restricted up to seven generations of gotra of father, mother, and grandmother.  In a few rural areas, marriage is banned within same local community is only allowed with those from outside of the community, as they consider a small village to be like brothers and sisters of one large family. These rules are strictly enforced and a couple breaking them is violently punished sometimes.[179]\n\nAnimals\nMany species of mammals, including humanity's closest primate relatives, tend to avoid mating with close relatives, especially if there are alternative partners available.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"2004\", \"title\": \"Inbreeding, Incest, and the Incest Taboo: The State of Knowledge at the Turn of the Century\", \"url\": \"https://books.google.com/books?id=OW1nuQxcIQgC&pg=PA6\", \"publisher\": \"Stanford University Press\", \"page\": \"169\", \"first\": \"Arthur P.\", \"last\": \"Wolf\", \"author2\": \"William H. Durham\"} However, some chimpanzees have been recorded attempting to mate with their mothers.[182] Male rats have been recorded engaging in mating with their sisters, but they tend to prefer non-related females over their sisters.[183]\nLivestock breeders often practice controlled breeding to eliminate undesirable characteristics within a population, which is also coupled with culling of what is considered unfit offspring, especially when trying to establish a new and desirable trait in the stock.\n\nInsects\nNorth Carolina State University found that bed bugs, in contrast to most other insects, tolerate incest and are able to genetically withstand the effects of inbreeding quite well.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.laboratoryequipment.com/news/2011/12/insect-incest-produces-healthy-offspring\", \"title\": \"Insect Incest Produces Healthy Offspring\", \"date\": \"8 December 2011\"}\n",
