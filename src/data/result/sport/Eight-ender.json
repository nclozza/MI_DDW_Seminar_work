    "content": "Eight-ender\nAn eight-ender, also called a snowman, is a perfect score within a single end of curling. In an end, both sides throw eight rocks, and in an eight-ender, all eight rocks from one team score points.\nEight-enders are extremely rare in competitive curling and are analogous to a perfect game in baseball or a perfect game in bowling (300). Eight-enders are so rare that the Canadian Curling Association has an award to recognize any eight-ender scored in Canada.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.curling.ca/about-the-organization/awards-and-certificates/eight-ender-awards/\", \"title\": \"About the CCA \\u2013 Awards and Certificates \\u2013 Eight Ender Awards\", \"publisher\": \"[[Canadian Curling Association]]\"} In 2007 Asham Curling Supplies awarded an $8000 prize randomly to one of the 145 teams that registered an eight-ender in the 2005\u201306 curling season.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://curlnews.blogspot.com/2007/01/8000-for-curling-8-ender.html\", \"title\": \"$8,000 for a curling 8-ender\", \"date\": \"19 January 2007\", \"publisher\": \"The Curling News Blog Archive\"}\nThe eight-ender in team curling is analogous to the six-ender in mixed doubles curling, as there is a total of six rocks in play per team instead of eight.\nThere has never been an eight-ender in Olympic competition, the closest being a 'seven-ender' scored by Scotland's Eve Muirhead at the 2014 Winter Olympics, in a 10\u20133 round-robin stage victory over the United States.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/blogs/eh-game/curling-rarity-eve-muirhead-great-britain-hang-seven-181426735.html\", \"title\": \"A curling rarity: Eve Muirhead and Great Britain hang a 'seven-ender' on the United States in Olympic curling\", \"publisher\": \"[[Yahoo|Yahoo Sports]]\"} In mixed doubles curling, the maximum score of six has been achieved at the Olympics, with Switzerland's Jenny Perret and Martin Rios doing so against the United States in the last end of their 9\u20134 round-robin win at the 2018 Winter Olympics.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.pyeongchang2018.com/en/game-time/results/OWG2018/en/curling/results-mixed-doubles-prel-000302-.htm\", \"title\": \"Curling - Results\", \"website\": \"PyeongChang 2018 Winter Olympic Games\", \"publisher\": \"PyeongChang 2018 Winter Olympic Games\"}\n\nSaskatchewan vs Quebec\nAt the 1952 Canadian Schoolboys Championship (now called the Canadian Junior Curling Championships), Saskatchewan's Gary Thode rink scored an eight ender against Quebec. The team would go on to win the match 17-5. To date, it has been the only eight-ender in Canadian juniors history. [5]\n\nConsecutive eight-enders\nIn 1993, the team of Kim Gellard, Corie Beveridge, Lisa Savage, and Sandy Graham recorded two consecutive eight-enders.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"2008\", \"title\": \"Curling, Etcetera: A Whole Bunch of Stuff About the Roaring Game\", \"location\": \"Mississauga\", \"publisher\": \"John Wiley & Sons Canada, Ltd.\", \"isbn\": \"9780470156131\", \"last\": \"Weeks\", \"first\": \"Bob\"}\n\nScott vs King\nPerhaps the most famous eight-ender occurred at the 2006 Players' Championships in Calgary, Alberta on April 15, 2006. The tournament was the final Grand Slam event in the 2005-06 Grand Slam of Curling and had a CAD$100,000 purse \u2013 one of the largest in women's curling.\nThe match between Kelly Scott, who at the time was the reigning Canadian women's champion and went on to become a world champion, and Cathy King a former world bronze medalist. In the 6th end of their match, King and her rink played rather poorly, while Scott and her rink capitalized on King's mistakes. King ricocheted her final stone out the side of a crowded house, leaving Scott a draw for 8. Although her shot was heavy, Scott's rock came to a stop eighteen inches from the back of the house, enough to score her eighth point.\n\nLeskiw vs Hamblin\nAnother notable eight-ender occurred on January 22, 2011 at the MCA Bonspiel, the world's largest bonspiel. In this match Leskiw stole his eight points. In curling, when the team that does not have last rock in the end scores, the points scored are termed as stolen points. In this game, Leskiw managed an eight-ender even though Hamblin had the last rock, which gave him the opportunity to score or prevent Leskiw from scoring eight. In fact, Hamblin knocked Leskiw's eighth rock into the house with his final shot, turning a seven-point end into an eight-ender.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.winnipegsun.com/sports/curling/2011/01/23/16997816.html\", \"title\": \"Historic eight-ender a showstopper at the Granite\", \"date\": \"12 January 2011\", \"publisher\": \"[[Winnipeg Sun]]\"}\n\nJacobs vs. Phillips\n2014 Olympic champion Brad Jacobs scored an eight-ender in the sixth end of the semi final of The Dominion 2012 Northern Ontario Men's Curling Championship against Tim Phillips in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. Jacobs had been leading 6-3 at the time, and had the hammer. After allowing the eight points, the Phillips rink conceded the game. On his last rock, Phillips ricocheted off two Jacobs stones, and out the rings, exposing one of his rocks that had been buried. Jacobs still had to make a delicate hit to ensure the Philips stone was removed, and he had to stick it to score his eight, which he did.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://dev.curlingzone.com/event.php?eventid=2665&view=Scores&showdrawid=14\", \"title\": \"2012 The Dominion Provincial Championship: Brad Jacobs vs Tim Phillips\", \"publisher\": \"CurlingZone\"}\n\nEinarson vs. McLean\nWinnipeg's Kerri Einarson scored an eight-ender in the seventh end of her first round robin game at the 2015 Manitoba Scotties Tournament of Hearts against Tiffany McLean of Brandon in Winkler on January 21, 2015. Einarson's rink stole the eight points, after having scored five points the previous end. Einarson won the game by a total score of 16-3. The feat was the first time an eight-ender had been scored at the Manitoba Scotties in recorded history.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"21 January 2015\", \"title\": \"Einarson scores first eight ender in Scotties history\", \"url\": \"http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/sports/curling/Einarson-scores-first-eight-ender-in-Scotties-history-289346401.html\", \"newspaper\": \"[[Winnipeg Free Press]]\"}\n\nAustralia vs. Hong Kong\nThe Australian men's team (skipped by Ian Palangio) scored an eight-ender in the first end of their match against Hong Kong (John Li) at the 2015 Pacific-Asia Curling Championships. The Aussies went on to win the match 16-3, after Hong Kong conceded after seven ends. It was the first international event for Hong Kong.[10]\n\nPrince Edward Island vs. Nunavut\nThe Prince Edward Island women's team (skipped by Lisa Jackson) scored an eight-ender in the first end of their match against Nunavut (Angela Dale) at the 2015 Travelers Curling Club Championship, Canada's national curling club championship.

The Koreans went on to win the match 30-0 with Qatar conceding after six ends. It was the first international event for Qatar.[13]\n\nUSA vs. Brazil\nThe United States women's national team skipped by Nina Roth scored an eight-ender in the sixth end of their first match against Brazil (skipped by Aline Gon\u00e7alves) at the 2017 Americas Challenge. The Americans went on to win the game 16-2 with the Brazilians immediately conceding after the 6th end. It was the first international event for the Brazilian women's team.[14]\n\nTardi vs. Schneider\nTyler Tardi and his team from Langley scored an eight-ender in the second end of their game against Team Stephen Schneider of Vancouver in their final round robin game at the 2018 King Cash Spiel, an event on the World Curling Tour. Even though it was just the second end, Team Schneider conceded, losing the game 10-0. Tardi went on to win the event.[15]\n",
