Initially the objective was to increase the duration of flights but soon pilots attempted cross-country flights away from the place of launch. Improvements in aerodynamics and in the understanding of weather phenomena have allowed greater distances at higher average speeds. Long distances are now flown using any of the main sources of rising air: ridge lift, thermals and lee waves. When conditions are favourable, experienced pilots can now fly hundreds of kilometres before returning to their home airfields; occasionally flights of more than 1,000 kilometres (621\u00a0mi) are achieved.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"title       \": \"Gliding World Records\", \"publisher   \": \"F\\u00e9d\\u00e9ration A\\u00e9ronautique Internationale Aeronautique\", \"url         \": \"http://records.fai.org/data?c=6\", \"accessdate  \": \"2010-05-06\", \"urlstatus     \": \"dead\", \"archiveurl  \": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20100507114138/http://records.fai.org/data?c=6\"}\nSome competitive pilots fly in races around pre-defined courses. These gliding competitions test pilots' abilities to make best use of local weather conditions as well as their flying skills. Local and national competitions are organized in many countries, and there are biennial World Gliding Championships.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"title       \": \"Contest Flying\", \"publisher   \": \"Soaring Society of America\", \"url         \": \"http://www.ssa.org/sport/whatissoaring9.asp\", \"accessdate  \": \"2010-05-06\", \"urlstatus     \": \"dead\", \"archiveurl  \": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20100515180944/http://www.ssa.org/sport/whatissoaring9.asp\"}{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"title \": \"Soaring Competitions\", \"publisher \": \"Soaring Society of America\", \"url \": \"https://www.ssa.org/files/member/BR%20Soaring%20Competition%20V4%2004.pdf\", \"format \": \"PDF\"}\nTechniques to maximize a glider's speed around the day's task in a competition have been developed, including the optimum speed to fly, navigation using GPS and the carrying of water ballast. If the weather deteriorates pilots are sometimes unable to complete a cross-country flight. Consequently, they may need to land elsewhere, perhaps in a field, but motorglider pilots can avoid this by starting an engine.\nPowered-aircraft and winches are the two most common means of launching gliders. These and other launch methods require assistance and facilities such as airfields, tugs, and winches. These are usually provided by gliding clubs who also train new pilots and maintain high safety standards. Although in most countries the standards of safety of the pilots and the aircraft are the responsibility of governmental bodies, the clubs and sometimes national gliding associations often have delegated authority.\n\nHistory\nThe development of heavier-than-air flight in the half century between Sir George Cayley's coachman in 1853 and the Wright brothers in 1903 mainly involved gliders (see History of aviation). However, the sport of gliding only emerged after the First World War, as a result of the Treaty of Versailles,{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"title \": \"History of gliding and soaring\", \"publisher \": \"Soaring Society of America\", \"url \": \"http://www.ssa.org/files/member/br%20soaring%20history%20v5%2004.pdf\", \"format \": \"PDF\"} which imposed severe restrictions on the manufacture and use of single-seat powered aircraft in Germany's Weimar Republic. Thus, in the 1920s and 1930s, while aviators and aircraft makers in the rest of the world were working to improve the performance of powered aircraft, the Germans were designing, developing and flying ever more efficient gliders and discovering ways of using the natural forces in the atmosphere to make them fly farther and faster. With the active support of the German government, there were 50,000 glider pilots by 1937.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"title \": \"Historical Perspective: Pilot, under vigilant eye of FBI, made trip to Terre Haute\", \"publisher \": \"Tribune Star\", \"date \": \"June 18, 2007\", \"url \": \"http://tribstar.com/history/x1155696240/Historical-Perspective-Pilot-under-vigilant-eye-of-FBI-made-trip-to-Terre-Haute\"}\nThe first German gliding competition was held at the Wasserkuppe in 1920,{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"title        \": \"Wasserkuppe\", \"publisher    \": \"International Scale Soaring Association\", \"url          \": \"http://www.soaringissa.org/Photos/Locations/Europe/Germany/Wasserkuppe/_htm/WasserkuppeIndex.htm\", \"accessdate   \": \"2010-05-06\", \"archiveurl  \": \"https://www.webcitation.org/614Isloy6?url=http://www.soaringissa.org/Photos/Locations/Europe/Germany/Wasserkuppe/_htm/WasserkuppeIndex.htm\", \"archivedate \": \"2011-08-20\"}{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"1980\", \"title\": \"The Story of Gliding 2nd edition\", \"publisher\": \"[[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]]\", \"last\": \"Welch\", \"first\": \"Ann\"}:51 organized by Oskar Ursinus.

Many were also aeronautical engineers who could design, build and maintain gliders. They started both clubs and manufacturers, many of which still exist. This stimulated the development of both gliding and gliders, for example the membership of the Soaring Society of America increased from 1,000 to 16,000 by 1980.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"last \": \"Schweizer\", \"first \": \"Paul\", \"title \": \"Wings Like Eagles, The Story of Soaring in the United States\", \"publisher \": \"Smithsonian Institution Press\", \"year \": \"1988\", \"isbn \": \"0-87474-828-3\", \"urlaccess \": \"registration\"} The increased numbers of pilots, greater knowledge and improving technology helped set new records, for example the pre-war altitude record was doubled by 1950,{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"1980\", \"title\": \"The Story of Gliding 2nd edition\", \"publisher\": \"[[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]]\", \"last\": \"Welch\", \"first\": \"Ann\"}:195 and the first 1,000-kilometre (620\u00a0mi) flight was achieved in 1964.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"title       \": \"First 1000km flight by Alvin Horne Parker\", \"publisher   \": \"F\\u00e9d\\u00e9ration A\\u00e9ronautique Internationale\", \"url         \": \"http://www.fai.org/igc-our-sport/badges-and-diplomas\", \"accessdate  \": \"2012-04-05\", \"urlstatus     \": \"dead\", \"archiveurl  \": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20120419061620/http://www.fai.org/igc-our-sport/badges-and-diplomas\"}\nNew materials such as glass fiber and carbon fiber, advances in wing shapes and airfoils, electronic instruments, the Global Positioning System and improved weather forecasting have since allowed many pilots to make flights that were once extraordinary.

Without clouds or dust devils to mark the thermals, thermals are not always associated with any feature on the ground. The pilot must then use both skill and luck to find them using a sensitive vertical speed indicator called a variometer that quickly indicates climbs and descents. Occasionally reliable thermals can be found in the exhaust gases from power stations or from fires.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"1978\", \"title\": \"Cross Country Soaring\", \"url\": \"https://archive.org/details/crosscountrysoar00reic\", \"publisher\": \"Thomson Publications\", \"last\": \"Reichmann\", \"first\": \"Helmut\", \"urlaccess\": \"registration\"} :6{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"last \": \"Delafield\", \"first \": \"John\", \"title \": \"Gliding Competitively\", \"publisher \": \"A&C Black, London\", \"year \": \"1982\"}:72{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"last \": \"Eckey\", \"first \": \"Bernard\", \"title \": \"Advanced Soaring Made Easy\", \"publisher \": \"EQIP Werbung & Verlag GmbH\", \"year \": \"2007\"}:29\nOnce a thermal is encountered, the pilot can fly in tight circles to keep the glider within the thermal, thus gaining altitude before flying toward the destination or to the next thermal. This is known as \"thermalling\". Alternatively, glider pilots on cross-country flights may choose to 'dolphin'. This is when the pilot merely slows down in rising air, and then speeds up again in the non-rising air, thus following an undulating flight path. Dolphining allows the pilot to minimize the loss of height over great distances without spending time turning. Climb rates depend on conditions, but rates of several meters per second are common and can be maximized by gliders equipped with flaps. Thermals can also be formed in a line usually because of the wind or the terrain, creating cloud streets. These can allow the pilot to fly straight while climbing in continuous lift.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"1978\", \"title\": \"Cross Country Soaring\", \"url\": \"https://archive.org/details/crosscountrysoar00reic\", \"publisher\": \"Thomson Publications\", \"last\": \"Reichmann\", \"first\": \"Helmut\", \"urlaccess\": \"registration\"}:61\nAs it requires rising heated air, thermalling is most effective in mid-latitudes from spring through late summer.

The engine is usually powered by LPG, petrol or diesel, though hydraulic fluid engines and electrical motors are also used. The winch pulls in a 1,000 to 2,500-metre (3,000 to 7,500\u00a0ft) cable, made of high-tensile steel wire or a synthetic fiber, attached to the glider. The cable is released at a height of about 35% of the cable length after a short, steep ride.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"1977\", \"title\": \"Understanding Gliding\", \"publisher\": \"Morrison & Gibb Ltd, London & Edinburgh\", \"last\": \"Piggott\", \"first\": \"Derek\"}:78 A strong headwind will result in higher launches.\nWinch launches are much cheaper than aerotows and permit a higher launch frequency. A winch may also be used at sites where an aerotow could not operate, because of the shape of the field or because of noise restrictions. The height gained from a winch is usually less than that from an aerotow, so pilots need to find a source of lift soon after releasing from the cable, or else the flight will be short. A break in the cable or the weak link[Note 1] during a winch launch is a possibility for which pilots are trained.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"1977\", \"title\": \"Understanding Gliding\", \"publisher\": \"Morrison & Gibb Ltd, London & Edinburgh\", \"last\": \"Piggott\", \"first\": \"Derek\"}:87{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"title \": \"Instructor Handbook\", \"author \": \"British Gliding Association\", \"year \": \"2003\"}:16\u20137\n\nAuto-tow\nAnother method of launching, the \"autotow\", is rarer nowadays.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"1977\", \"title\": \"Understanding Gliding\", \"publisher\": \"Morrison & Gibb Ltd, London & Edinburgh\", \"last\": \"Piggott\", \"first\": \"Derek\"} The direct autotow requires a hard surface and a powerful vehicle that is attached to the glider by a long steel cable. After gently taking up slack in the cable, the driver accelerates hard and as a result the glider rises rapidly to about 400\u00a0metres (1,300\u00a0ft), especially if there is a good headwind and a runway of 1.5 kilometres (0.93\u00a0mi) or more. This method has also been used on desert dry lakes.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"title       \": \"Las Vegas Soaring Association Newsletter Nov 2009\", \"publisher   \": \"Las Vegas Soaring Association\", \"url         \": \"http://www.lvvsa.org/PDFs/Newsletters/News-09-11.pdf\", \"format      \": \"PDF\", \"accessdate  \": \"2010-05-21\", \"urlstatus     \": \"dead\", \"archiveurl  \": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20101228160403/http://lvvsa.org/PDFs/Newsletters/News-09-11.pdf\"}\nA variation on the direct autotow is known as the \"reverse pulley\" method. In this method, the truck drives towards the glider being launched. The cable passes around a pulley at the far end of the airfield, resulting in an effect similar to that of a winch launch.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"1977\", \"title\": \"Understanding Gliding\", \"publisher\": \"Morrison & Gibb Ltd, London & Edinburgh\", \"last\": \"Piggott\", \"first\": \"Derek\"}\n\nBungee launch\nBungee launching was widely used in the early days of gliding, and occasionally gliders are still launched from the top of a gently sloping hill into a strong breeze using a substantial multi-stranded rubber band, or \"bungee\".{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.glidingmagazine.com/FeatureArticle.asp?id=386\", \"title\": \"Bungee launching\", \"last\": \"Ellis\", \"first\": \"Chris\", \"year\": \"2004\", \"publisher\": \"Gliding & Motorgliding International\", \"accessdate\": \"2010-05-06\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20051230175936/http://www.glidingmagazine.com/FeatureArticle.asp?id=386\"} For this launch method, the glider's main wheel rests in a small concrete trough. The hook normally used for winch-launching is instead attached to the middle of the bungee. Each end is then pulled by three or four people. One group runs slightly to the left, the other to the right. Once the tension in the bungee is high enough, the glider is released and the glider's wheel pops out of the trough. The glider gains just enough energy to leave the ground and fly away from the hill.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.glidingmagazine.com/FeatureArticle.asp?id=386\", \"title\": \"Bungee launching\", \"last\": \"Ellis\", \"first\": \"Chris\", \"year\": \"2004\", \"publisher\": \"Gliding & Motorgliding International\", \"accessdate\": \"2010-05-06\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20051230175936/http://www.glidingmagazine.com/FeatureArticle.asp?id=386\"}\n\nGravity launch\nA glider can simply be pushed down a slope until gravity can create enough speed for it to take off.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"title\": \"YouTube clip of a gravity launch\", \"accessdate\": \"25 January 2018\"}\n\nCross-country\nOne of the measures of a glider's performance is the distance that it can fly for each meter it descends, known as its glide ratio. Glide ratio is dependent on an aircraft's class, and can typically range from 44:1 (for modern designs in the Standard Class) up to 70:1 (for the largest aircraft). A good gliding performance combined with regular sources of rising air enables modern gliders to fly long distances at high speeds.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"1978\", \"title\": \"Cross Country Soaring\", \"url\": \"https://archive.org/details/crosscountrysoar00reic\", \"publisher\": \"Thomson Publications\", \"last\": \"Reichmann\", \"first\": \"Helmut\", \"urlaccess\": \"registration\"}{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"title       \": \"Cross-country flying\", \"publisher   \": \"Soaring Society of America\", \"url         \": \"http://www.ssa.org/sport/whatissoaring5.asp\", \"accessdate  \": \"2010-05-06\", \"urlstatus     \": \"dead\", \"archiveurl  \": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20100515180440/http://www.ssa.org/sport/whatissoaring5.asp\"} The weather is a major factor in determining cross-country speeds.

The winner is the pilot who has amassed the greatest number of points over all the contest days. However, these competitions have as yet failed to draw much interest outside the gliding community for several reasons. Because it would be unsafe for many gliders to cross a start line at the same time, pilots can choose their own start time.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"title       \": \"BGA Competition Handbook 2010\", \"publisher   \": \"British Gliding Association\", \"url         \": \"http://www.gliding.co.uk/forms/competitionrules2010.pdf\", \"format      \": \"PDF\", \"accessdate  \": \"2010-05-21\", \"urlstatus     \": \"dead\", \"archiveurl  \": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20110716180443/http://www.gliding.co.uk/forms/competitionrules2010.pdf\"} Furthermore, gliders are not visible to the spectators for long periods during each day's contest and the scoring is complex, so traditional gliding competitions are difficult to televise. In an attempt to widen the sport's appeal, a new format, the Grand Prix, has been introduced.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"title \": \"FAI web-site\\u2014Sailplane Grand Prix\", \"publisher \": \"F\\u00e9d\\u00e9ration A\\u00e9ronautique Internationale Aeronautique\", \"url \": \"http://www.fai.org/gliding/sgp\", \"accessdate \": \"2010-05-06\", \"archiveurl \": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20100501231607/http://www.fai.org/gliding/sgp\"} Innovations introduced in the Grand Prix format include simultaneous starts for a small number of gliders, cockpit mounted cameras, telemetry giving the positions of the gliders, tasks consisting of multiple circuits, and simplified scoring.\nThere is a decentralized Internet-based competition called the Online Contest, in which pilots upload their GPS data files and are automatically scored based on distance flown. Worldwide, 6,703\u00a0pilots registered for this contest in 2010.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"title \": \"On-line Contest\", \"publisher \": \"[[Aerokurier]]\", \"url \": \"http://www.onlinecontest.org/olc-2.0/segelflugszene/index.html\"}\n\nMaximizing average speed\nSoaring pioneer Paul MacCready is usually credited with developing mathematical principles for optimizing the speed at which to fly when cross-country soaring,{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"title \": \"Glider Flying Handbook\", \"year \": \"2003\", \"publisher \": \"U.S. Federal Aviation Administration\", \"location \": \"U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington D.C.\", \"id \": \"FAA-8083-15\", \"pages \": \"4\\u20138\"}:11-10 although it was first described by Wolfgang Sp\u00e4te in 1938.{\"citetype\": \"journal\", \"last \": \"Pettersson\", \"first \": \"\\u00c5ke\", \"title \": \"Letters\", \"journal \": \"Sailplane & Gliding\", \"volume \": \"57\", \"issue \": \"5\", \"page \": \"6\", \"publisher \": \"British Gliding Association\"} The speed to fly theory allows the optimal cruising speed between thermals to be computed, using thermal strength, glider performance and other variables. It accounts for the fact that if a pilot flies faster between thermals, the next thermal is reached sooner. However at higher speeds the glider also sinks faster, requiring the pilot to spend more time circling to regain the altitude. The MacCready speed represents the optimal trade-off between cruising and circling. Most competition pilots use MacCready theory to optimize their average speeds, and have the calculations programmed in their flight computers, or use a \"McCready ring\", a rotatable bezel on the glider's variometer to indicate the best speed to fly. The greatest factor in maximizing average speed, however, remains the ability of the pilot to find the strongest lift.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"1978\", \"title\": \"Cross Country Soaring\", \"url\": \"https://archive.org/details/crosscountrysoar00reic\", \"publisher\": \"Thomson Publications\", \"last\": \"Reichmann\", \"first\": \"Helmut\", \"urlaccess\": \"registration\"}:56\nOn cross-country flights on days when strong lift is forecast, pilots fly with water ballast stored in tanks or bags in the wings and fin. The fin tank is used to reduce trim drag by optimizing the center of gravity, which typically would shift forward if water is stored only in the wings ahead of the spar.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"title \": \"Glider Flying Handbook\", \"year \": \"2003\", \"publisher \": \"U.S. Federal Aviation Administration\", \"location \": \"U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington D.C.\", \"id \": \"FAA-8083-15\", \"pages \": \"4\\u20138\"}:5\u201313 Ballast enables a sailplane to attain its best lift-to-drag ratio (L/D) at higher speeds but slows its climb rate in thermals, in part because a sailplane with a heavier wing loading cannot circle within a thermal as tightly as one with a lower, unballasted wing loading. But if lift is strong, typically either from thermals or wave, the disadvantage of slower climbs is outweighed by the higher cruising speeds between lift areas. Thus, the pilot can improve the average speed over a course by several percent or achieve longer distances in a given time.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"1978\", \"title\": \"Cross Country Soaring\", \"url\": \"https://archive.org/details/crosscountrysoar00reic\", \"publisher\": \"Thomson Publications\", \"last\": \"Reichmann\", \"first\": \"Helmut\", \"urlaccess\": \"registration\"}:63 If lift is weaker than expected, or if an off-field landing is imminent, the pilot can jettison the water ballast by opening the dump valves.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"1978\", \"title\": \"Cross Country Soaring\", \"url\": \"https://archive.org/details/crosscountrysoar00reic\", \"publisher\": \"Thomson Publications\", \"last\": \"Reichmann\", \"first\": \"Helmut\", \"urlaccess\": \"registration\"}:64\nOn days with particularly strong and widespread lift pilots can attain high average speeds by alternating periods of fast flight with pull-ups, merely slowing down in areas of lift without deviating from the course. This 'dolphining' technique can result in high average speeds because the height lost can be minimised until particularly strong lift is encountered when circling would be most effective.\n\nBadges\nAchievements in gliding have been marked by the awarding of badges since the 1920s.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"title       \": \"Soaring proficiency awards\", \"publisher   \": \"Soaring Society of America\", \"url         \": \"http://www.ssa.org/sport/whatissoaring7.asp\", \"accessdate  \": \"2010-05-06\", \"urlstatus     \": \"dead\", \"archiveurl  \": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20100515180513/http://www.ssa.org/sport/whatissoaring7.asp\"}{\"citetype\": \"journal\", \"last        \": \"Eckschmiedt\", \"first       \": \"George\", \"author2     \": \"John Bisscheroux\", \"title       \": \"A Modest Proposal (1.3 Mb)\", \"journal     \": \"Free Flight\", \"volume      \": \"2004\", \"issue       \": \"1\", \"pages       \": \"8\\u20139, 18\", \"publisher   \": \"Soaring Association of Canada\", \"date        \": \"February\\u2013March 2004\", \"url         \": \"http://www.wgc.mb.ca/sac/freeflight/04_01.pdf\", \"format      \": \"PDF\", \"accessdate  \": \"2008-01-08\", \"urlstatus     \": \"dead\", \"archiveurl  \": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20080216024059/http://www.wgc.mb.ca/sac/freeflight/04_01.pdf\"} For the lower badges, such as the first solo flight, national gliding federations set their own criteria.

The Gold and Diamond Badges require pilots to fly higher and further. A pilot who has completed the three parts of the Diamond Badge has flown 300 kilometres (186\u00a0mi) to a pre-defined goal, has flown 500 kilometres (311\u00a0mi) in one flight (but not necessarily to a pre-defined goal) and gained 5,000 metres (16,000\u00a0ft) in height. The FAI also issues a diploma for a flight of 1,000 kilometres (621\u00a0mi) and further diplomas for increments of 250 kilometres (155\u00a0mi).{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"title       \": \"Gliding Badges and Diplomas\", \"publisher   \": \"F\\u00e9d\\u00e9ration A\\u00e9ronautique Internationale Aeronautique\", \"url         \": \"http://www.fai.org/igc-our-sport/badges-and-diplomas\", \"accessdate  \": \"2010-05-06\", \"urlstatus     \": \"dead\", \"archiveurl  \": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20111020124415/http://www.fai.org/igc-our-sport/badges-and-diplomas\"}\n\nLanding out\nIf lift is not found during a cross-country flight, for example because of deteriorating weather, the pilot must choose a location to \"land out\".{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"1978\", \"title\": \"Cross Country Soaring\", \"url\": \"https://archive.org/details/crosscountrysoar00reic\", \"publisher\": \"Thomson Publications\", \"last\": \"Reichmann\", \"first\": \"Helmut\", \"urlaccess\": \"registration\"} Although inconvenient and often mistaken for \"emergency landings\", landing out (or \"outlanding\") is a routine event in cross-country gliding. The pilot has to choose a location where the glider can be landed safely, without damaging the plane, the pilot, or property such as crops or livestock.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"title       \": \"BGA Laws & Rules\\u2014Code of practice for field landings\", \"publisher   \": \"British Gliding Association\", \"url         \": \"http://www.gliding.co.uk/forms/lawsandrules.pdf\", \"format      \": \"PDF\", \"accessdate  \": \"2010-05-06\", \"urlstatus     \": \"dead\", \"archiveurl  \": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20090612061807/http://www.gliding.co.uk/forms/lawsandrules.pdf\"} The glider and the pilot(s) can then be retrieved by road from the outlanding location using a purpose-built trailer. In some instances, a tow-plane can be summoned to re-launch the aircraft.\n\nUse of engines or motors\nAlthough adding to the weight and expense, some gliders are fitted with small power units and are known as motor gliders.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.schempp-hirth.com/index.php?id=184&L=1\", \"title\": \"LS8-st: 15/18 Meter Standard-Turbo made by DG\", \"publisher\": \"Schemmp-Hirth Flugzeugbau GmbH\", \"accessdate\": \"2010-05-06\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20110613203245/http://www.schempp-hirth.com/index.php?id=184&L=1\"} This avoids the inconvenience of landing out. The power units can be internal combustion engines, electrical motors, or retractable jet engines. Retractable propellers are fitted to high performance sailplanes, though in another category, called touring motor gliders, non-retractable propellers are used. Some powered gliders are \"self launching\", which makes the glider independent of a tow plane. However some gliders have \"sustainer\" engines that can prolong flight but are not powerful enough for launching. All power units have to be started at a height that includes a margin that would still allow a safe landing out to be made, if there were a failure to start.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"last \": \"Eckey\", \"first \": \"Bernard\", \"title \": \"Advanced Soaring Made Easy\", \"publisher \": \"EQIP Werbung & Verlag GmbH\", \"year \": \"2007\"}:130{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"last \": \"Ewald\", \"first \": \"Jochen\", \"title \": \"LS8-st: 15/18 Meter Standard-Turbo made by DG\", \"publisher \": \"DG Flugzeugbau GmbH\", \"date \": \"September\\u2013October 2005\", \"url \": \"http://www.dg-flugzeugbau.de/ls8-ewald-e.html\", \"format \": \"PDF\"}\nIn a competition, using the engine ends the soaring flight.

To avoid other gliders and general aviation traffic, pilots must comply with the Rules of the Air and keep a good lookout. They also usually wear parachutes. In several European countries and Australia, the FLARM warning system is used to help avoid mid-air collisions between gliders.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"last \": \"Feakes\", \"first \": \"Richard\", \"title \": \"Electronic Collision Avoidance\", \"publisher \": \"Bicester Aviation Services\", \"url \": \"http://www.bas.uk.net/data6.html\"} A few modern gliders have a ballistic emergency parachute to stabilize the aircraft after a collision.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"last \": \"Sperber\", \"first \": \"Martin\", \"title \": \"Safety Aspects for Glider Pilots\", \"publisher \": \"DG Flugzeugbau\", \"url \": \"http://www.dg-flugzeugbau.de/sich-details-e.html\"}\n\nTraining and regulation\nIn addition to national laws controlling aviation, the sport in many countries is regulated through national gliding associations and then through local gliding clubs. Much of the regulation concerns safety and training.\nMany clubs provide training for new pilots. The student flies with an instructor in a two-seat glider fitted with dual controls. The instructor performs the first launches and landings, typically from the back seat, but otherwise the student manages the controls until the student is deemed to have the skill and the airmanship necessary to fly solo.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"title \": \"Learning to fly Gliders\\u2014Earning your Glider Rating\", \"publisher \": \"Soaring Society of America\", \"url \": \"http://www.ssa.org/sport/whatissoaring2.asp\"} Simulators are also beginning to be used in training, especially during poor weather.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"title \": \"Silent Wings\", \"publisher \": \"Silent Wings AS\", \"url \": \"http://www.silentwings.no/\"}\nAfter the first solo flights glider pilots are required to stay within gliding range of their home airfield. In addition to solo flying, further flights are made with an instructor until the student is capable of taking a glider cross-country and of handling more difficult weather. Cross-country flights are allowed when they have sufficient experience to find sources of lift away from their home airfield, to navigate, and to select and land in a field if necessary. In most countries pilots must take a written examination on the regulations, navigation, use of the radio, weather, principles of flight and human factors. Proposals are being made to standardise the training requirements across European countries.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"title       \": \"Comment Response Document (CRD) to Notice of Proposed Amendment (NPA) 2008-17B for an Agency Opinion on a Commission Regulation establishing the Implementing Rules for the licensing of pilots\", \"publisher   \": \"European Aviation Safety Agency\", \"url         \": \"http://www.easa.europa.eu/ws_prod/r/doc/CRD%20b.2%20-%20Combined%20Subparts%20+%20Appendices.pdf\", \"format      \": \"PDF\", \"accessdate  \": \"2010-05-21\", \"urlstatus     \": \"dead\", \"archiveurl  \": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20100530023249/http://www.easa.europa.eu/ws_prod/r/doc/CRD%20b.2%20-%20Combined%20Subparts%20+%20Appendices.pdf\"}\nIn addition to the regulation of pilots, gliders are inspected annually and after exceeding predetermined flight times. Maximum and minimum payloads are also defined for each glider. Because most gliders are designed to the same specifications of safety, the upper weight limit for a pilot, after allowing for a parachute, is usually 103 kilograms (227\u00a0lb). There is also a limit, 193 centimetres (6\u00a0ft 4\u00a0in), on the tallest pilots who can safely fit into a typical glider's cockpit.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"title \": \"Who can glide?\", \"publisher \": \"British Gliding Association\", \"url \": \"http://www.gliding.co.uk/learningtoglide/whocanglide.htm\"}\n\nChallenges for the gliding movement\nAccording to the FAI President, gliding as a sport faces challenges in the years ahead.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"title       \": \"IGC Keynote Speech, Lausanne\", \"author      \": \"Wolfgang Weinreich, F\\u00e9d\\u00e9ration A\\u00e9ronautique Internationale Aeronautique\", \"date        \": \"2005-03-04\", \"publisher   \": \"Gliding and Motorgliding International\", \"url         \": \"http://www.glidingmagazine.com/NewsArticle.asp?id=1404&y=2005\", \"accessdate  \": \"2010-05-06\", \"urlstatus     \": \"dead\", \"archiveurl  \": \"https://archive.is/20141130080529/http://www.glidingmagazine.com/NewsArticle.asp?id=1404&y=2005\"} These include:\n\nRelated air sports\nThe two air sports that are most closely related to gliding are hang gliding and paragliding. Although all three sports rely on rising air, there are significant differences which are listed in detail in a comparison of sailplanes hang gliders and paragliders. The main difference is that both hang gliders and paragliders are simpler, less sophisticated and cheaper aircraft that use the pilot's feet as the undercarriage.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"title       \": \"Hang Gliding\", \"publisher   \": \"F\\u00e9d\\u00e9ration A\\u00e9ronautique Internationale Aeronautique\", \"url         \": \"http://www.fai.org/hang_gliding/hang_gliding\", \"accessdate  \": \"2010-05-06\", \"urlstatus     \": \"dead\", \"archiveurl  \": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20100427071142/http://www.fai.org/hang_gliding/hang_gliding\"} All paragliders and most hang gliders have no protective structure around the pilot. However, the dividing line between basic gliders and sophisticated hang-gliders is becoming less distinct. For example, hang gliders typically use fabric wings, shaped over a framework, but hang gliders with rigid wings and three-axis controls are also available. The lower air speeds and lower glide ratios of typical hang gliders means that shorter cross-country distances are flown than in modern gliders. Paragliders are more basic craft. They are also foot-launched, but their wings usually have no frames and their shape is created by the flow and pressure of air.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"title       \": \"Paragliding\", \"publisher   \": \"F\\u00e9d\\u00e9ration A\\u00e9ronautique Internationale Aeronautique\", \"url         \": \"http://www.fai.org/hang_gliding/paragliding\", \"accessdate  \": \"2010-05-06\", \"urlstatus     \": \"dead\", \"archiveurl  \": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20100512031116/http://www.fai.org/hang_gliding/paragliding\"} The airspeeds and glide ratios of paragliders are generally lower still than the typical hang gliders, and so their cross-country flights are even shorter. Radio-controlled gliding uses scale-models of gliders mainly for ridge soaring; however thermic aeromodelling craft are also used.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"title       \": \"Home Page of the International Aeromodelling Commission\", \"publisher   \": \"F\\u00e9d\\u00e9ration A\\u00e9ronautique Internationale Aeronautique\", \"url         \": \"http://www.fai.org/aeromodelling/\", \"accessdate  \": \"2010-05-06\", \"urlstatus     \": \"dead\", \"archiveurl  \": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20100427085817/http://www.fai.org/aeromodelling/\"}\n",
