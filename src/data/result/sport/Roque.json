Popular in the first quarter of the 20th century and billed \"the Game of the Century\" by its enthusiasts,[citation needed] it was an Olympic sport in the 1904 Summer Games, replacing croquet from the previous games.\n\nRoque court and equipment\nRoque is played on a hard sand or clay 30 by 60\u00a0foot (approximately 9 by 19\u00a0m) court bordered by a boundary wall, a curb bevelled at the ends to form an octagon. Players use this wall to bank balls similarly to how billiard balls are played off the cushions of a billiard table.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.spring.net/sports/roque/rules.html\", \"title\": \"Official Rules and Regulations\", \"year\": \"1959\", \"publisher\": \"American Roque League\", \"location\": \"[[Dallas, TX]]\", \"accessdate\": \"2009-06-02\", \"author\": \"McGowan, B. C.\", \"work\": \"Roque: The Game of the Century\"}\nThe wickets, called arches, are permanently anchored in the court. The arches are narrow as in professional six-wicket croquet. The court has ten arches in seven points configured in a double diamond (or figure-8). The two farthest end points and the central point of the figure-8 are double arches (one after the other) while the four side (or corner) points have single arches. Each arch of the double arches at either end of the court count as a separate arch, but the double arches in the center (which are closer together) are scored as a single arch.  While in nine-wicket croquet the single central wicket opens up to the length of the court facing the stakes, in roque the double center arches face the sides of the court.  Roque uses two stakes: at the head of the court is the \"head stake,\" the other stake at the far end of the court is the \"turning stake.\"{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.spring.net/sports/roque/rules.html\", \"title\": \"Official Rules and Regulations\", \"year\": \"1959\", \"publisher\": \"American Roque League\", \"location\": \"[[Dallas, TX]]\", \"accessdate\": \"2009-06-02\", \"author\": \"McGowan, B. C.\", \"work\": \"Roque: The Game of the Century\"}\nThe mallets with which the balls are struck have a shorter handle (approx. 24 inches) than croquet mallets. One end of the mallet is surfaced with rubber, the other with wood, plastic, or aluminum.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.spring.net/sports/roque/rules.html\", \"title\": \"Official Rules and Regulations\", \"year\": \"1959\", \"publisher\": \"American Roque League\", \"location\": \"[[Dallas, TX]]\", \"accessdate\": \"2009-06-02\", \"author\": \"McGowan, B.

C.\", \"work\": \"Roque: The Game of the Century\"}\n\nHistorical roque\nThe name \"roque\" was suggested by Samuel Crosby of New York City in 1899, who came to it by removing the initial \"c\" and final \"t\" from \"croquet.\"{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.spring.net/sports/roque/rules.html\", \"title\": \"Official Rules and Regulations\", \"year\": \"1959\", \"publisher\": \"American Roque League\", \"location\": \"[[Dallas, TX]]\", \"accessdate\": \"2009-06-02\", \"author\": \"McGowan, B.

An historic roque court in Clinton, Illinois, was restored to playing condition in 2013.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.dewittdailynews.com/news/details.cfm?id=79630\", \"title\": \"Class of 73 To Dedicate Park Back To City of Clinton\", \"work\": \"Dewitt Daily News\"}{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.dewittdailynews.com/news/details.cfm?clientid=22&id=9050\", \"title\": \"Peace Park Continues Move Forward\", \"work\": \"Dewitt Daily News\"} A roque tournament is held annually in Angelica, New York.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.angelicaheritagedays.com/hdevents.html\", \"title\": \"Heritage Days\"}\n",
