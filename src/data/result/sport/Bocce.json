Developed into its present form in Italy, bocce is played around Europe and also in other areas with Italian immigrants, including Australia, North America, and South America. Initially played only by the Italian immigrants, the game has slowly become more popular with their descendants and more broadly.\n\nHistory\nBocce is closely related to British bowls and French p\u00e9tanque, all having developed from games played in the Roman Empire. It was developed into its present form in Italy[6] (where it is called bocce, the plural of the Italian word boccia which means 'bowl' in the sport sense),{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/italian-english/boccia\", \"title\": \"boccia\", \"accessdate\": \"8 November 2012\", \"via\": \"CollinsDictionary.com\", \"work\": \"Collins Italian\\u2013English\"} it is played around Europe and also in regions to which Italians have migrated, such as Australia, North America, and South America (where it is known as bochas, or bolas criollas ('Criollo balls') in Venezuela, bocha in Brazil). The popularity of the game spread first amongst descendants of Italian migrants but has slowly spread into the wider community.\n\nGeographical spread\nThe sport is also very popular on the eastern side of the Adriatic, especially in Croatia, Serbia, Montenegro, and Bosnia and Herzegovina, where the sport is known in Serbo-Croatian as bo\u0107anje ('playing bo\u0107e') or balote (colloquially also bu\u0107anje).[8][9][10] In Slovenia the sport is known as balinanje{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://portal.balinarska-zveza.si/\", \"title\": \"Bocce Association of Slovenia\", \"accessdate\": \"16 June 2010\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20100611221558/http://portal.balinarska-zveza.si/\", \"archivedate\": \"11 June 2010\"} or colloquially 'playing bo\u010de', or bale (from Italian bocce and Venetian ba\u0142e, meaning 'balls').{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.etno-muzej.si/en/spletne-zbirke/klasifikacije/igra-odraslih\", \"title\": \"Slovene Ethnographic Museum\", \"accessdate\": \"13 March 2012\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20130622091515/http://www.etno-muzej.si/en/spletne-zbirke/klasifikacije/igra-odraslih\", \"archivedate\": \"22 June 2013\"}\n\nRules and play\nBocce is traditionally played on natural soil and asphalt courts 27.5 metres (90\u00a0ft) in length and 2.5 to 4 metres (8.2 to 13.1\u00a0ft) wide.[13]  Bocce balls can be made of wood (traditional), metal[14], baked clay, or various kinds of plastic. Unlike lawn bowls, bocce balls are spherical and have no inbuilt bias.   \nA game can be conducted between two players, or two teams of two, three, or four. A match is started by a randomly chosen side being given the opportunity to throw a smaller ball, the jack (called a boccino ('little bocce') or pallino ('bullet' or 'little ball') in Italian, depending on local custom), from one end of the court into a zone 5 metres (16\u00a0ft) in length, ending 2.5 metres (8.2\u00a0ft) from the far end of the court. If the first team misses twice, the other team is awarded the opportunity to place the jack anywhere they choose within the prescribed zone.[15]  Casual play is common in reasonably flat areas of parks and yards lacking a Bocce court, but players should agree to the minimum and maximum distance the jack may be thrown before play begins.\nThe side that first attempted to place the jack is given the opportunity to bowl first. Once the first bowl has taken place, the other side has the opportunity to bowl. From then on, the side which does not have the ball closest to the jack has a chance to bowl, up until one side or the other has used their four balls. At that point, the other side bowls its remaining balls. The object of the game is for a team to get as many of its balls closer to the target ball (jack, boccino, pallino) than the opposing team.  The team with the closest ball to the jack is the only team that can score points in any frame. The scoring team receives one point for each of their balls that is closer to the jack than the closest ball of the other team. The length of a game varies by region but is typically from 7 to 13 points.[16][17]\nPlayers are permitted to throw the ball in the air using an underarm action. This is generally used to knock either the jack or another ball away to attain a more favorable position. Tactics can get quite complex when players have sufficient control over the ball to throw or roll it accurately.[18]\n\nBocce volo\nA variation called bocce volo uses a metal ball, which is thrown overhand (palm down), after a run-up to the throwing line. In that latter respect, it is similar to the French boules game jeu proven\u00e7al also known as boule lyonnaise.  A French variant of the game is called p\u00e9tanque, and (lacking the run-up) is more similar in some respects to traditional bocce.[19]\n\nBoccia\nAnother development, for persons with disabilities, is called boccia. It is a shorter-range game, played with leather balls on an indoor, smooth surface. Boccia was first introduced to the Paralympics at the 1984 New York/Stoke Mandeville Summer Games, and is one of the only two Paralympic sports that do not have an Olympic counterpart (the other being goalball).{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.paralympic.org/boccia\", \"title\": \"Boccia\", \"publisher\": \"[[International Paralympic Committee]]\", \"accessdate\": \"12 March 2018\", \"work\": \"Paralympic.org\"}\n",
