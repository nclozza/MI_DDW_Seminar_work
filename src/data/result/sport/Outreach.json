Outreach commonly takes place physically at local community institutions such as libraries, community centres and markets.[3] Compared with traditional service providers, outreach services are provided closer to where people live, are voluntary, and have fewer, if any, enforceable obligations.[3]\nOutreach can target various populations, from sex workers{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"date\": \"16 December 2010\", \"title\": \"New Sociologies of Sex Work\", \"url\": \"https://books.google.com/books?id=toGlsIgAW8oC&pg=PA77\", \"publisher\": \"Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.\", \"isbn\": \"978-0-7546-7986-8\", \"accessdate\": \"16 September 2012\", \"author1\": \"Kate Hardy\", \"author2\": \"Sarah Kingston\", \"author3\": \"Teela Sanders\"} and drug users{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"1996\", \"title\": \"Outreach Work with Drug Users: Principles and Practice\", \"url\": \"https://books.google.com/books?id=8TdgVBbiLrcC&pg=PA25\", \"publisher\": \"Council of Europe\", \"isbn\": \"978-92-871-3110-2\", \"accessdate\": \"17 September 2012\", \"author\": \"Tim Rhodes\"} to museum goers.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"date\": \"1 October 2002\", \"title\": \"Adult Museum Programs: Designing Meaningful Experiences\", \"url\": \"https://books.google.com/books?id=994oW6syTAwC&pg=PA53\", \"publisher\": \"Rowman Altamira\", \"isbn\": \"978-0-7591-0097-8\", \"accessdate\": \"17 September 2012\", \"author\": \"Bonnie Sachatello-Sawyer\"}\n\nExternal links\n Media related to Outreach at Wikimedia Commons\n",
