    "content": "Juldarigi\n\nJuldarigi (Korean:\u00a0\uc904\ub2e4\ub9ac\uae30, also chuldarigi) is a traditional Korean sport similar to tug of war. It has a ritual and divinatory significance to many agricultural communities in the country, and is performed at festivals and community gatherings. The sport uses two huge rice-straw ropes, connected by a central peg, which are pulled by teams representing the East and West sides of the village (the competition is often rigged in favour of the Western team). A number of religious and traditional rituals are performed before and after the actual competition.\nSeveral areas of Korea have their own distinct variations of juldarigi, and similar tug-of-war games with connections to agriculture are found in rural communities across Southeast Asia.\n\nCultural significance\nJuldarigi is an important part of several agricultural celebrations, and is a common event at the Daeboreum lunar festival.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://folkency.nfm.go.kr/eng/subjectindex.jsp?d=seasonal&tit_idx=238&f=F5\", \"title\": \"Encyclopedia of Korean Folk Culture\", \"publisher\": \"National Folk Museum of Korea\"}\nAs with many Korean rural folk traditions, the sport is regarded as a predictor of future events, specifically harvests. The outcome of a ritualised contest between the two sides of a village (East and West) was seen as an indicator of the abundance (or otherwise) of that year's rice crop, which would be harvested in the autumn; as a result, juldarigi and similar folk sports are predominant in the rice-growing areas of the South.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://folkency.nfm.go.kr/eng/subjectindex.jsp?d=seasonal&tit_idx=238&f=F5\", \"title\": \"Encyclopedia of Korean Folk Culture\", \"publisher\": \"National Folk Museum of Korea\"}{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.arirang.co.kr/Tv2/TVCommon_NoStaff_Archive.asp?PROG_CODE=TVCR0556&MENU_CODE=101233&view_seq=4177&Page=5&sys_lang=Eng\", \"title\": \"Yeongsan juldarigi\", \"publisher\": \"Arirang TV\", \"work\": \"100 Icons of Korean Culture\"} This is due to the common association in Southeast Asia between dragons (which the ropes of the juldarigi are thought to resemble) and rain; as a result juldarigi or similar tug-of-war ceremonies have also historically been staged during periods of drought.{\"citetype\": \"journal\", \"year\": \"1995\", \"title\": \"Tug-of-War: Pulling the Rope for a Bumper Harvest\", \"url\": \"http://koreana.kf.or.kr/view.asp?article_id=683\", \"journal\": \"Koreana\", \"volume\": \"9\", \"issue\": \"4\", \"last\": \"Kim\", \"first\": \"Kwang-on\"} The connection of the two ropes used (with one rope's smaller loop being placed through the other's larger loop) is reminiscent of sexual intercourse, which also gives rise to the sport's association with fecundity.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://folkency.nfm.go.kr/eng/subjectindex.jsp?d=seasonal&tit_idx=238&f=F5\", \"title\": \"Encyclopedia of Korean Folk Culture\", \"publisher\": \"National Folk Museum of Korea\"}\n\nEquipment\nThe straw ropes used in juldarigi are immense, up to 200m in length and 1m in diameter. They can weigh as much as 40 tons.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.dangjin.go.kr/html/eng/culture/culture_01_09.html\", \"title\": \"Gijisi Juldarigi Museum\", \"work\": \"Energetic Dangjin\"} They are constructed of twisted rice straw; this choice of material is symbolic, since rice is the staple grain in the areas where juldarigi is practiced. The construction process is a communal event, reflecting the communal nature of rice cultivation.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.arirang.co.kr/Tv2/ALegacy_Archive.asp?PROG_CODE=tvcr0301&view_cont_seq=25&code=St1&sys_lang=Eng\", \"title\": \"Gijisijuldarigi, A Tug-Of-War Held to Pray for A Bountiful Harvest\", \"publisher\": \"Arirang TV\", \"work\": \"Ancestral Legacies\"} Two ropes are used, one for each team; they are connected by a wooden beam or stump known as a binyeomok, around three metres long.{\"citetype\": \"journal\", \"year\": \"1995\", \"title\": \"Tug-of-War: Pulling the Rope for a Bumper Harvest\", \"url\": \"http://koreana.kf.or.kr/view.asp?article_id=683\", \"journal\": \"Koreana\", \"volume\": \"9\", \"issue\": \"4\", \"last\": \"Kim\", \"first\": \"Kwang-on\"}{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.ichcap.org:8888/en/archives/unescoView2.jsp?ich_name=ICH_LIST3_ENG&idx=&listLIDX=36&searchtext=\", \"title\": \"Republic of Korea: Folk games and rite\", \"publisher\": \"UNESCO\", \"accessdate\": \"23 April 2013\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://archive.is/20140806163906/http://www.ichcap.org:8888/en/archives/unescoView2.jsp?ich_name=ICH_LIST3_ENG&idx=&listLIDX=36&searchtext=\", \"work\": \"ICH Archives\"} The rope held by the Eastern team is termed the sutjul (Korean:\u00a0\uc22b\uc904 \"male rope\") and the Western team hold the amjul (Korean:\u00a0\uc554\uc904 \"female rope\").{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://folkency.nfm.go.kr/eng/subjectindex.jsp?d=seasonal&tit_idx=238&f=F5\", \"title\": \"Encyclopedia of Korean Folk Culture\", \"publisher\": \"National Folk Museum of Korea\"}  Because of the ropes' great size, they cannot be grasped directly; players attached smaller side-ropes to the main rope to act as handles and fray its ends to provide additional hand-holds.{\"citetype\": \"journal\", \"year\": \"1995\", \"title\": \"Tug-of-War: Pulling the Rope for a Bumper Harvest\", \"url\": \"http://koreana.kf.or.kr/view.asp?article_id=683\", \"journal\": \"Koreana\", \"volume\": \"9\", \"issue\": \"4\", \"last\": \"Kim\", \"first\": \"Kwang-on\"}{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.ichcap.org:8888/en/archives/unescoView2.jsp?ich_name=ICH_LIST3_ENG&idx=&listLIDX=36&searchtext=\", \"title\": \"Republic of Korea: Folk games and rite\", \"publisher\": \"UNESCO\", \"accessdate\": \"23 April 2013\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://archive.is/20140806163906/http://www.ichcap.org:8888/en/archives/unescoView2.jsp?ich_name=ICH_LIST3_ENG&idx=&listLIDX=36&searchtext=\", \"work\": \"ICH Archives\"}\n\nCeremony\nThe ceremony leading up to the tug of war begins at around midnight on the eve of the festival. Both teams repair to their respective ropes and offer prayers for victory; this rite is known as goyu (Korean:\u00a0\uace0\uc720; Hanja:\u00a0\u544a\u7531). During this time, the teams guard their ropes against tampering, as well as preventing members of the opposing team from stepping over it (it is believed that a woman who steps over the rope at this time will conceive a male heir). Punishments can be severe; there are records of a woman being stoned to death in the early 20th century for such an infraction.{\"citetype\": \"journal\", \"year\": \"1995\", \"title\": \"Tug-of-War: Pulling the Rope for a Bumper Harvest\", \"url\": \"http://koreana.kf.or.kr/view.asp?article_id=683\", \"journal\": \"Koreana\", \"volume\": \"9\", \"issue\": \"4\", \"last\": \"Kim\", \"first\": \"Kwang-on\"} The teams then gather at the festival site and perform further prayers, this time for the safety and prosperity of the village; sacrifices are also offered to Teojushin, the earth goddess. These communal rituals are called gosa (Korean:\u00a0\uace0\uc0ac; Hanja:\u00a0\u544a\u7940). At dawn, after the completion of these ceremonies, the two teams fetch their ropes to the site; this involves a procession with flags and costumes, accompanied by percussion music. There is then a staged debate over the connection of the two ropes, which has a symbolic sexual aspect; innuendo and bawdy taunts of the other team are common.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://folkency.nfm.go.kr/eng/subjectindex.jsp?d=seasonal&tit_idx=238&f=F5\", \"title\": \"Encyclopedia of Korean Folk Culture\", \"publisher\": \"National Folk Museum of Korea\"}{\"citetype\": \"journal\", \"year\": \"1995\", \"title\": \"Tug-of-War: Pulling the Rope for a Bumper Harvest\", \"url\": \"http://koreana.kf.or.kr/view.asp?article_id=683\", \"journal\": \"Koreana\", \"volume\": \"9\", \"issue\": \"4\", \"last\": \"Kim\", \"first\": \"Kwang-on\"}\nOnce the two ropes are lashed together around the binyeomok, the contest begins, to the shouts and cheers of the celebrants. The actual competition is short, with victory usually decided after a single pull (although some contests are played to best of three). Because of the association of the Western direction with the concept of fertility and fecundity, the match is often fixed to ensure that the West team win (and thus ensure a bounteous harvest). After celebrating at the house of their team's captain, the winners will then proceed to the house of the losing team's captain to offer their commiserations; this often resembles a funeral procession.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://folkency.nfm.go.kr/eng/subjectindex.jsp?d=seasonal&tit_idx=238&f=F5\", \"title\": \"Encyclopedia of Korean Folk Culture\", \"publisher\": \"National Folk Museum of Korea\"} Both ropes are taken by the winning team, dissected and sold; the straw taken from them is believed to have unusual protective or nourishing properties.{\"citetype\": \"journal\", \"year\": \"1995\", \"title\": \"Tug-of-War: Pulling the Rope for a Bumper Harvest\", \"url\": \"http://koreana.kf.or.kr/view.asp?article_id=683\", \"journal\": \"Koreana\", \"volume\": \"9\", \"issue\": \"4\", \"last\": \"Kim\", \"first\": \"Kwang-on\"}\nA children's version, known as gosat juldarigi (Korean:\u00a0\uace0\uc0bf\uc904\ub2e4\ub9ac\uae30, \"alley tug-of-war\") is often played in the streets before the main event.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://folkency.nfm.go.kr/eng/subjectindex.jsp?d=seasonal&tit_idx=238&f=F5\", \"title\": \"Encyclopedia of Korean Folk Culture\", \"publisher\": \"National Folk Museum of Korea\"}\n\nRegional variations\nTwo forms of juldarigi, from Gijisi (Dangjin) and Yeongsang, are recognised as Important Intangible Cultural Properties of Korea.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.arirang.co.kr/Tv2/ALegacy_Archive.asp?PROG_CODE=tvcr0301&view_cont_seq=25&code=St1&sys_lang=Eng\", \"title\": \"Gijisijuldarigi, A Tug-Of-War Held to Pray for A Bountiful Harvest\", \"publisher\": \"Arirang TV\", \"work\": \"Ancestral Legacies\"}{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.ichcap.org:8888/en/archives/unescoView2.jsp?ich_name=ICH_LIST3_ENG&idx=&listLIDX=36&searchtext=\", \"title\": \"Republic of Korea: Folk games and rite\", \"publisher\": \"UNESCO\", \"accessdate\": \"23 April 2013\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://archive.is/20140806163906/http://www.ichcap.org:8888/en/archives/unescoView2.jsp?ich_name=ICH_LIST3_ENG&idx=&listLIDX=36&searchtext=\", \"work\": \"ICH Archives\"}{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"2008\", \"title\": \"One hundred cultural symbols of Korea\", \"url\": \"https://books.google.com/books?id=OFoqAQAAIAAJ\", \"publisher\": \"Discovery Media\", \"accessdate\": \"23 April 2013\", \"author1\": \"My\\u01d2ng-jong Yu\", \"author2\": \"Ji-Hye Lee\", \"author3\": \"Sung-young Jeon\"}{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"2001\", \"title\": \"Korean Intangible Cultural Properties: .
