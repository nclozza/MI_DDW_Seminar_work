The following year after competing in the event for the second time and placing in the top ten Johnstone desired more of this style of race and with equal emphasis on the swim, so he petitioned the chairman of the San Diego Track Club who told him he would add a race to the club calendar but the rest of the race was up to Johnstone to organise and at the same time to contact Don Shanahan so there wouldn't be too many \"weird\" races on the club schedule. Shanahan told Johnstone that he wanted to include a biking leg to the race, whilst hesitant Johnstone agreed to the addition. When naming the event the pair used the unofficially agreed naming system for multisport event (already used for pentathlon, heptathlon, and decathlon), of using the prefix Greek number for the number of events trias (three) and suffix of athlos the Greek for a competition, hence named the event the Mission Bay Triathlon.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.etymonline.com/word/triathlon\", \"title\": \"triathlon {{!}} Origin and meaning of triathlon by Online Etymology Dictionary\", \"website\": \"etymonline.com\", \"language\": \"en\"} It is worthy of note that neither founder had heard of the French events, both believing their race a unique idea.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"title\": \"Triathlon' A Personal History by Scott Tinley\", \"last\": \"Tinley\", \"first\": \"Scott\"}\nOn Wednesday, September 25, 1974 the race started, it began with a run of a three-mile loop, then biking twice around Fiesta Island for a total of five miles entrants would then get off the bikes, take their shoes off and run into the water swimming to the mainland, then ran in bare feet before swimming again along the bay, then did one last swim up to the entrance of Fiesta Island before crawling up a steep dirt bank to finish.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.kpbs.org/news/2014/dec/11/san-diegans-remember-first-triathlon-40-years-ago/\", \"title\": \"San Diegans Remember World's First Triathlon 40 Years Ago \\u2014 At Mission Bay\", \"last\": \"Trageser\", \"first\": \"Claire\", \"website\": \"KPBS Public Media\", \"language\": \"en\"} Most participants were not skilled swimmers, so Johnstone recruited his 13-year-old son to float on his surfboard and act as lifeguard.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.triathlonhistory.com/\", \"title\": \"Story of the First Triathlon\", \"website\": \"triathlonhistory.com\"}{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.kpbs.org/news/2014/dec/11/san-diegans-remember-first-triathlon-40-years-ago/\", \"title\": \"San Diegans Remember World's First Triathlon 40 Years Ago \\u2014 At Mission Bay\", \"last\": \"Trageser\", \"first\": \"Claire\", \"website\": \"KPBS Public Media\", \"language\": \"en\"} Also some participants took longer than expected, and it began to get dark as they finished their swims.

The Netherlands, Belgium and West Germany follow after, all hosting an event in 1981, but the media coverage of these events is almost non-existent.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"date\": \"2009\", \"title\": \"20 ans de passion! 20 ans de triathlon! : 1989-2009\", \"others\": \"F\\u00e9d\\u00e9ration fran\\u00e7aise de triathlon.\", \"location\": \"Marseille\", \"pages\": \"12\", \"isbn\": \"978-2907590594\", \"last\": \"Gasquet\", \"first\": \"Frank\"}\nThen in 1982, the event organiser IMG, worked in partnership with the American channel CBS (direct competitor of ABC who held the exclusive rights to Hawaii), to create a new event that would take place in Europe. The initial aim was to establish a new premier competition, the European Triathlon, with the goal of being of the same size and prestige to directly compete with that of Hawaii.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.ligue-ca-triathlon.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/30-ans-du-Triathlon-de-Nice_83-92.pdf\", \"title\": \"30 years of nice triathlon\", \"date\": \"19 October 2014\", \"website\": \"ligue-ca-triathlon.com\", \"archiveurl\": \"http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ligue-ca-triathlon.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2012%2F11%2F30-ans-du-Triathlon-de-Nice_83-92.pdf\", \"archivedate\": \"22 October 2015\"} Originally the event was to be hosted in Monaco, but with the death of Princess Grace in September 1982 the previous agreements fell through; however, IMG refused to cancel the event so it was reorganised to be hosted in Nice, France. The first Nice Triathlon was held on 20 November 1982 where fifty seven competitors took the start, for an ill-defined competition that consisted of 1,500 meters of swimming, 100 kilometres of cycling and a marathon.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.fftri.com/lhistoire-du-triathlon\", \"title\": \"Histoire du triathlon:1982\", \"website\": \"ffrti.com\"} In December of that year the national television station France 2 broadcast a program, Voyage au bout de la souffrance (Journey to the End of Suffering) which detailed the events of the Nice Triathlon.

The Nice triathlon was, alongside Hawaii, one of the two important Long Distance races each year for both prize money and media attention.[citation needed]\nThe year 1985 saw the creation of the first international triathlon structure, the European Triathlon Union (ETU) with the objectives to federate the triathlon structures in each European country and to act as a counterbalance to American triathlon in the creation of a future worldwide federation.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://fftri.com/lhistoire-du-triathlon\", \"title\": \"Histoire du triathlon\", \"website\": \"fftri.com\", \"accessdate\": \"11 November 2015\", \"urlstatus\": \"live\", \"archiveurl\": \"http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20160106140022/http://fftri.com/lhistoire-du-triathlon\", \"archivedate\": \"6 January 2016\"} The following year, the eleven nations that composed the ETU met in Brussels to standardise the national structures of each European country. During this time France dominated discussions, as it was the only federation recognised by its own National Olympic Committee. With the legitimacy from CONADET, forerunner of the French Triathlon Federation (FFTri), which has been organising triathlon in France since 1984 the French system became standard all over Europe.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://fftri.com/lhistoire-du-triathlon\", \"title\": \"Histoire du triathlon\", \"website\": \"fftri.com\", \"accessdate\": \"11 November 2015\", \"urlstatus\": \"live\", \"archiveurl\": \"http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20160106140022/http://fftri.com/lhistoire-du-triathlon\", \"archivedate\": \"6 January 2016\"}\n\nA global federation\nThe  first attempt to create a global triathlon entity was the Triathlon Federation International (TFI), it had only 22 members most of which were national European federations. But immediately fights of influences broke out between the European and UK-American federations over many issues, particularly in view of a favourable vote system for the ETU, this causes immediate fracturing and the TFI never fully establish itself.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://fftri.com/lhistoire-du-triathlon\", \"title\": \"Histoire du triathlon\", \"website\": \"fftri.com\", \"accessdate\": \"11 November 2015\", \"urlstatus\": \"live\", \"archiveurl\": \"http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20160106140022/http://fftri.com/lhistoire-du-triathlon\", \"archivedate\": \"6 January 2016\"}\nAround the same time, Canadian Les McDonald held talks with Juan Antonio Samaranch, then President of the International Olympic Committee. Samaranch had already declared his intention to add triathlon to the Olympic games as fast as possible, and assured that triathlon could appear as a demonstration sport at the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona but only under the auspices of the International Union of Modern Pentathlon and Biathlon (UIPMB).{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.fftri.com/la-federation/historique/\", \"title\": \"Historique de Triathlon 1994\", \"website\": \"FFTRI\", \"language\": \"fr-FR\", \"archiveurl\": \"http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20160106140022/http://fftri.com/lhistoire-du-triathlon\", \"archivedate\": \"6 January 2016\"}{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.triathlon.org/about\", \"title\": \"Inside ITU\", \"last\": \"Union\", \"first\": \"International Triathlon\", \"website\": \"Triathlon.org\", \"language\": \"en\"} Many within the triathlon community were unhappy with the arrangement wishing for their own federation not to be held as part of UIPMB. Unable to accept the offer, Samaranch established an Olympic working committee for triathlon in an effort to form a consensus on an Olympic route for the sport. McDonald was selected as President of the committee, while Sweden's Sture Jonasson was elected as Secretary.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.triathlon.org/about\", \"title\": \"Inside ITU\", \"last\": \"Union\", \"first\": \"International Triathlon\", \"website\": \"Triathlon.org\", \"language\": \"en\"}\nThen in February 1989, an informal meeting was held in Vancouver, Canada where members of the working committee worked nonstop for a week on the statutes and regulations of the future International Triathlon Union (ITU). Then on 1 April 1989, 30 National Federations attended the first ITU Congress in Avignon, France. After further discussions on the way forward to reach the Olympics, including the refusal to follow the path of the UIPMB and how triathlon should develop both economically and as a sport, the Congress endorses the creation of the International Triathlon Union and elects its first executive committee. McDonald was elected President.

ITU races are conducted in a draft legal format for the bike leg, whereas drafting is not permitted at the amateur level. In addition, the ITU has a Long Distance Triathlon series.\nThe World Triathlon Corporation (WTC) is a private company that sanctions and organises the Ironman and Ironman 70.3 races each year. These races serve as qualifying events for their own annual World Championships. The Ironman World Championship is held annually in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii in October while the Ironman 70.3 World Championship is held in September and changes location each year. The \"Ironman\" and \"Iron\" brands are property of the WTC. Therefore, long-distance multi-sport events organized by groups other than the WTC may not officially be called \"Ironman\" or \"Iron\" races.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"8 April 2008\", \"title\": \"Iron Man calls this fight a draw\", \"url\": \"http://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/article/58837\", \"accessdate\": \"24 June 2010\", \"last\": \"Williams\", \"first\": \"Pete\"} For its part, the ITU does not sanction WTC races;{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.triathlon.org/news/article/congress_votes_to_no_longer_sanction_ironman/\", \"title\": \"Congress votes to no longer sanction Ironman\", \"date\": \"14 September 2005\", \"publisher\": \"International Triathlon Union\"} however, USAT uses a combination of ITU and WTC rules to sanction WTC's branded events.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.slowtwitch.com/headings/ironman.html\", \"title\": \"Ironman and USAT are again brothers in arms\", \"date\": \"27 March 2006\", \"publisher\": \"Slowtwitch.com\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20110718171602/http://www.slowtwitch.com/headings/ironman.html\", \"archivedate\": \"18 July 2011\"}\nMany other organisations exist from local clubs hosting one 100 entrant race a year up to companies like the Challenge Family brand produces long-distance events around the world, and includes events like Challenge Roth.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.challenge-family.com/about-challenge-family/\", \"title\": \"About Challenge Family\", \"publisher\": \"TEAMChallenge\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20140106211906/http://www.challenge-family.com/about-challenge-family/\", \"archivedate\": \"6 January 2014\"} International Ultra-Triathlon Association (IUTA) is the official governing body of Ultratriathlon, which involves triathlon in distances longer than an iron-distance race.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.iutasport.com/\", \"title\": \"International Ultra-Triathlon Association\", \"publisher\": \"International Ultra Triathlon Association\"}\n\nConflict\nTwo major rule making bodies, the ITU and WTC, had an overlap of rules and authority, an issue which began to create conflict in the 2000s.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.runningnetworkarchives.com/runnertriathletenews/news/413.html\", \"title\": \"Ironman Triathlon to take ITU to court to retain name\", \"website\": \"runningnetworkarchives.com\"} This culminated in 2005 when the ITU and USAT asked all national triathlon federations to refuse to continue sanctioning any WTC events.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.triathlon.org/news/article/usat_breaks_with_ironman_races\", \"title\": \"USAT Breaks with Ironman Races\", \"last\": \"Union\", \"first\": \"International Triathlon\", \"date\": \"13 June 2005\", \"website\": \"Triathlon.org\", \"language\": \"en\"} The reasons for this stemmed from WTC not recognising the ITU as the sport's governing body as WTC was attempting to set up their own federation. Furthermore, ITU and USAT argued against supporting WTC because they were a profit driven organisation, that it was directly conflicting with ITU titles, such as the long and standard distance world championship, and that the WTC was not following World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) rules. If ITU member nations did not comply with International Olympic Committee (IOC) Charter rules they risked being excluded from the Olympic program.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.triathlon.org/news/article/congress_votes_to_no_longer_sanction_ironman\", \"title\": \"Congress votes to no longer sanction Ironman\", \"last\": \"Union\", \"first\": \"International Triathlon\", \"date\": \"14 September 2005\", \"website\": \"Triathlon.org\", \"language\": \"en\"} However, in 2006, the ITU backed down on its stance allowing national federations to once again sanction WTC events.

Distances can be any combination of distance set by race organizers to meet various distance constraints or to attract a certain type of athlete.\nThe standard Olympic distance of 1.5/40/10 km (0.93/24.8/6.2 miles) was created by longtime triathlon race director Jim Curl in the mid-1980s, after he and partner Carl Thomas produced the U.S. Triathlon Series (USTS) between 1982 and 1997.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.usatriathlon.org/news/2010/01/14/usa-triathlon-hall-of-fame-banquet-caps-memorable-weekend/30568\", \"title\": \"USA Triathlon Hall of Fame Banquet Caps Memorable Weekend\", \"date\": \"14 January 2010\", \"publisher\": \"USA Triathlon\", \"accessdate\": \"4 October 2010\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20110107134304/http://www.usatriathlon.org/news/2010/01/14/usa-triathlon-hall-of-fame-banquet-caps-memorable-weekend/30568\"}\nIn addition to the above distances, two new long-distance events have appeared, the 111 and 222 events. The 111 distance is 1\u00a0km (0.62\u00a0mi) swimming, 100\u00a0km (62\u00a0mi) bicycling and 10\u00a0km (6.2\u00a0mi) running, totalling 111\u00a0km (69\u00a0mi). The 222 distance is double that.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://star-events.cc/site/index.php/en/star-events/tristar/general-info\", \"title\": \"TriStar Triathlon Events\", \"publisher\": \"Star Production SARL\", \"accessdate\": \"22 February 2012\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20120314100517/http://star-events.cc/site/index.php/en/star-events/tristar/general-info\"}\nMost triathlons are individual events. Another format is relay triathlons, where a team of competitors take turns to compete at a race; each competitor must do a segment of swimming, cycling and running. The ITU Team Triathlon World Championships began with two separate classifications for men and women. In 2009, it adopted a 4x4 mixed relay format, where each team has two men and two women. The triathlon at the Youth Olympic Games also has a 4x mixed relay since 2010, and the event will be introduced at the 2020 Summer Olympics\nThe ITU accepts a 5% margin of error in the cycle and run course distances.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www2.triathlon.org/rules/rules-2003/general-competition-rules-revised-2003PDF.PDF\", \"title\": \"ITU Competition Rules\", \"year\": \"2003\", \"accessdate\": \"13 December 2005\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20060614113838/http://www2.triathlon.org/rules/rules-2003/general-competition-rules-revised-2003PDF.PDF\", \"author\": \"International Triathlon Union\"} Though there can be some variation in race distances, particularly among short triathlons, most triathlons conform to one of those above standards.\n\nRace organization\nIn general, participation in a triathlon requires an athlete to register and sign up in advance of the actual race. After registration, racers are often provided a race number, colored swim cap, and, if the event is being electronically timed, a timing band. Athletes will either be provided or briefed on details of the course, rules, and any problems to look out for (road conditions, closures, traffic lights, aid stations).{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"last1\": \"Watson\", \"first1\": \"Lance\", \"last2\": \"Motz\", \"first2\": \"Jason\", \"year\": \"2010\", \"title\": \"First Triathlon: Your Perfect Plan to Success\", \"url\": \"https://books.google.com/books?id=qJdicyVqjRAC&pg=PA13&dq=#v=onepage&q&f=false\", \"publisher\": \"Meyer & Meyer Verlag\", \"isbn\": \"978-1-84126-116-4\"} At a major event, such as an Ironman or a long course championship, triathletes may be required to set up and check-in their bike in the transition area a day or two before the race start, leaving it overnight and under guard.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://ironman.com/assets/files/races/worldchampionship/pdf/2009_Ford_Ironman_World_Championship_Athlete_Guide.pdf\", \"title\": \"2009 Athlete Information Guide&nbsp;\\u2013 Ironman World Championship\", \"year\": \"2009\", \"publisher\": \"Ironman&nbsp;\\u2013 World Triathlon Corporation\", \"page\": \"9\", \"accessdate\": \"15 June 2010\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20091007104151/http://ironman.com/assets/files/races/worldchampionship/pdf/2009_Ford_Ironman_World_Championship_Athlete_Guide.pdf\"}\nOn the day of the race, before the start of competition, athletes will generally be provided with a bike rack to hold their bicycle and a small section of ground space for shoes, clothing, etc. in the transition area. In some triathlons, there are two transition areas, one for the swim/bike change, then one for the bike/run change at a different location.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"1987\", \"title\": \"Triathlon: going the distance\", \"publisher\": \"Contemporary Books\", \"isbn\": \"978-0-8092-4774-5\", \"last\": \"Plant\", \"first\": \"Mike\"}\nRacers are generally categorized into separate professional and amateur categories. Amateurs, who make up the large majority of triathletes, are often referred to as \"age groupers\" since they are typically further classified by sex and age; which offers the opportunity to compete against others of one's own gender and age group. The age groups are defined in five- or ten-year intervals.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"1987\", \"title\": \"Triathlon: going the distance\", \"publisher\": \"Contemporary Books\", \"isbn\": \"978-0-8092-4774-5\", \"last\": \"Plant\", \"first\": \"Mike\"} There is typically a lower age limit; which can vary from race to race. In some triathlons, heavier amateur athletes may have the option to compete against others closer to their own weight since weight is often considered an impediment to speed. As an example, under USA Triathlon rules, \"Clydesdale\" athletes are those men over 220\u00a0lb (100\u00a0kg), while \"Athena\" athletes are women over 165\u00a0lb (75\u00a0kg).{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.usatriathlon.org/about-multisport/rulebook.aspx\", \"title\": \"USA Triathlon Competitive Rules\", \"date\": \"January 2013\", \"publisher\": \"[[USA Triathlon]]\"} Other races and organizations can choose whether or not to offer Clydesdale- and Athena-type divisions and set their own weight standards.\nDepending on the type and size of the race, there may be any of the following methods implemented to start the race. In a mass start, all athletes enter the water and begin the competition following a single start signal. In wave start events, smaller groups of athletes begin the race every few minutes. An athlete's wave is usually determined either by age group or by predicted swim time. Wave starts are more common in shorter races where a large number of amateur athletes are competing.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"2009\", \"title\": \"The sports rules book\", \"edition\": \"3\", \"publisher\": \"Human Kinetics\", \"isbn\": \"978-0-7360-7632-6\", \"last\": \"Hanlon\", \"first\": \"Thomas W.\"} Another option is individual time trial starts, where athletes enter the water one at a time, a few seconds apart.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.napervilletri.com/article.php?story=wavestart\", \"title\": \"Age Group Time Trial Swim Start\", \"year\": \"2010\", \"publisher\": \"HRMS Naperville Sprint Triathlon\", \"accessdate\": \"23 September 2010\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20090810120445/http://www.napervilletri.com/article.php?story=wavestart\"}\nThe swim leg usually proceeds around a series of marked buoys before athletes exit the water near the transition area. Racers exit out of the water, enter the transition area, and change from their swim gear and into their cycling gear. Competition and pressure for faster times have led to the development of specialized triathlon clothing that is adequate for both swimming and cycling, allowing many racers to have a transition that consists of only removing their wetsuit, cap, and goggles and pulling on a helmet and cycling shoes. In some cases, racers leave their cycling shoes attached to their bicycle pedals and slip their feet into them while riding. Some triathletes don't wear socks, decreasing their time spent in transition even more.\nThe cycling stage proceeds around a marked course, typically on public roads. In many cases, especially smaller triathlons, roads are not closed to automobiles; however, traffic coordinators are often present to help control traffic. Typically, the cycling stage finishes back at the same transition area. Racers enter the transition area, rack their bicycles, and quickly change into running shoes before heading out for the final stage. The running stage usually ends at a separate finish line near the transition area.\nIn most races, \"aid stations\" located on the bike and run courses provide water and energy drinks to the athletes as they pass by. Aid stations at longer events may often provide various types of food as well, including such items as energy bars, energy gels, fruit, cookies, soup, and ice.\nOnce the triathletes have completed the event, there is typically another aid station for them to get water, fruit, and other post-race refreshments. Occasionally, at the end of larger or longer events, the provided amenities and post-race celebrations may be more elaborate.\n\nRules of triathlon\nWhile specific rules for triathlon can vary depending on the governing body (e.g. USA Triathlon, ITU), as well as for an individual race venue, there are some basic universal rules. Traditionally, triathlon is an individual sport and each athlete is competing against the course and the clock for the best time. As such, athletes are not allowed to receive assistance from anyone else outside the race, with the exception of race-sanctioned aid volunteers who distribute food and water on the course.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://assets.usoc.org/assets/documents/attached_file/filename/24727/2010_Most_Commonly_Violated_Rules.pdf\", \"title\": \"2010 Most Common Rules Violations\", \"year\": \"2010\", \"publisher\": \"USA Triathlon\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20100601235146/http://assets.usoc.org/assets/documents/attached_file/filename/24727/2010_Most_Commonly_Violated_Rules.pdf\", \"archivedate\": \"1 June 2010\"}{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.triathlon.org/images/uploads/ituevents_competition-rules-2010_2010-02-11.pdf\", \"title\": \"ITU Competition Rules\", \"date\": \"23 January 2010\", \"publisher\": \"International Triathlon Union\"}\nTriathlons are timed in five sequential sections:\nResults are usually posted on official websites and will show for each triathlete his/her swim time; cycle time (with transitions included); run time; and total time.

Competitors may not begin riding their bicycle out of transition until they are over a clearly marked line. Mounting the bike prior to this may incur a penalty (example: a 15-second time penalty at the London 2012 Olympics was awarded to Jonathan Brownlee, a competitor from Great Britain, for mounting his bike too early.){\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.triathlon.org/images/uploads/ituevents_competition-rules-2010_2010-02-11.pdf\", \"title\": \"ITU Competition Rules\", \"date\": \"23 January 2010\", \"publisher\": \"International Triathlon Union\"}{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.triathlon.org/news/article/alistair_brownlee_storms_to_olympic_gold_at_london_2012\", \"title\": \"Alistair Brownlee storms to Olympic gold at London 2012\", \"date\": \"August 2012\", \"publisher\": \"International Triathlon Union\"}\nOther time penalties can be incurred during the race for, among other things, drafting on the bike in a non-drafting race, improper passing, littering on course, and unsportsmanlike conduct.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.usatriathlon.org/about-multisport/rulebook.aspx\", \"title\": \"USA Triathlon Competitive Rules\", \"date\": \"January 2013\", \"publisher\": \"[[USA Triathlon]]\"}{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.usatriathlon.org/about-multisport/multisport-zone/rules-education/articles/time-penalties-37.aspx\", \"title\": \"Rules Education: Time Penalties\", \"publisher\": \"USA Triathlon\", \"accessdate\": \"5 March 2014\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20140922065556/http://www.usatriathlon.org/about-multisport/multisport-zone/rules-education/articles/time-penalties-37.aspx\", \"archivedate\": \"22 September 2014\"}\n\nTriathlon and fitness\nParticipants in triathlon often use the sport to improve or maintain their physical fitness.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.menshealth.com/fitness/20-great-reasons-do-triathlon\", \"title\": \"20 Great Reasons to do a Triathlon\", \"last\": \"Harr\", \"date\": \"6 July 2005\", \"publisher\": \"Men's Health\", \"accessdate\": \"2 June 2011\"}{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"2008\", \"title\": \"Championship Triathlon Training\", \"publisher\": \"Human Kinetics\", \"page\": \"286\", \"last\": \"Dallam\", \"first\": \"George M.\"} With each sport being an endurance event, training for a triathlon provides cardiovascular exercise benefits.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.livestrong.com/article/254575-cardio-exercise-ideas/\", \"title\": \"Cardio Exercise Ideas\", \"accessdate\": \"2 June 2011\"} Additionally, triathletes encounter fewer injuries than those who only use running as part of their exercise routine due to the incorporation of low impact swim and bike training.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.military.com/military-fitness/running/triathlon-training\", \"title\": \"Triathlon Training\", \"last\": \"Smith\", \"first\": \"Stew\", \"accessdate\": \"2 June 2011\"}\nTriathletes spend many hours training for competitions, like other endurance event participants.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"2004\", \"title\": \"Triathlon Training\", \"publisher\": \"Human Kinetics\", \"page\": \"[https://archive.org/details/triathlontrainin0000finc/page/71 71]\", \"isbn\": \"978-0-7360-5444-7\", \"last\": \"Finch\", \"first\": \"Michael\"} There are three components that have been researched to improve endurance sports performance; aerobic capacity, lactate threshold, and economy.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"title\": \"Your Best Triathlon\", \"page\": \"15\", \"last\": \"Friel\", \"first\": \"Joe\"} Injuries that are incurred from long hours of a single activity are not as common in triathlon as they are in single sport events.

Many triathletes use altered swim strokes to compensate for turbulent, aerated water and to conserve energy for a long swim. In addition, the majority of triathlons involve open-water (outdoor) swim stages, rather than pools with lane markers. As a result, triathletes in the swim stage must jockey for position, and can gain some advantage by drafting, following a competitor closely to swim in their slipstream. Triathletes will often use \"dolphin kicking\" and diving to make headway against waves, and body surfing to use a wave's energy for a bit of speed at the end of the swim stage. Also, open-water swims necessitate \"sighting\": raising the head to look for landmarks or buoys that mark the course. A modified stroke allows the triathlete to lift the head above water to sight without interrupting the swim or wasting energy.\nBecause open water swim areas are often cold and because wearing a wetsuit provides a competitive advantage, specialized triathlon wetsuits have been developed in a variety of styles to match the conditions of the water. For example, wetsuits that are sleeveless and cut above the knee are designed for warmer waters, while still providing buoyancy. Wetsuits are legal in sanctioned events at which the surface water temperature is 26\u00a0\u00b0C (79\u00a0\u00b0F) or less.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.usatriathlon.org/about-multisport/rulebook.aspx\", \"title\": \"USA Triathlon Competitive Rules\", \"date\": \"January 2013\", \"publisher\": \"[[USA Triathlon]]\"}  In non-sanctioned events or in \"age group\" classes where most racers are simply participating for the enjoyment of the sport instead of vying for official triathlon placing, wetsuits can often be used at other temperatures. Race directors will sometimes discourage or ban wetsuits if the water temperature is above 29\u00a0\u00b0C (84\u00a0\u00b0F) due to overheating that can occur while wearing a wetsuit.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url \": \"http://triathlonwetsuitstore.com/at-what-temps-can-you-use-a-wetsuit\", \"title \": \"At what temps can you use a wetsuit?\", \"publisher \": \"TriathlonWetsuitStore.com\"} Other rules have been implemented by race organizers regarding both wetsuit thickness as well as the use of \"swim skins;\" which need to be considered by those participating in future triathlons. Some triathlon sanctioning bodies have placed limits on the thickness of the wetsuit material. Under ITU and some national governing bodies' rules no wetsuit may have a thickness of more than 5\u00a0mm (0.20\u00a0in).{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://triathlon.competitor.com/2010/06/news/usa-triathlon-adopts-new-wetsuit-regulation-starting-in-2013_10173\", \"title\": \"USA Triathlon Adopts New Wetsuit Regulation Starting In 2013\", \"publisher\": \"Competitor Group, Inc.\", \"accessdate\": \"June 4, 2013\"}\n\nCycling\nTriathlon cycling can differ from most professional bicycle racing depending on whether drafting is allowed during competition. In some competitions, like those governed by USA Triathlon and the World Triathlon Corporation, drafting is not allowed,{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.usatriathlon.org/about-multisport/rulebook.aspx\", \"title\": \"USA Triathlon Competitive Rules\", \"date\": \"January 2013\", \"publisher\": \"[[USA Triathlon]]\"} and thus the cycling portion more closely resembles individual time trial racing. In other races, such as those in World Cup and Championship racing, drafting and the formation of pelotons are legal.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"last1\": \"Garrett\", \"first1\": \"William E.\", \"last2\": \"Kirkendall\", \"first2\": \"Donald T.\", \"year\": \"2000\", \"title\": \"Exercise and sport science\", \"url\": \"https://books.google.com/books?id=Cx22TcXodrwC&pg=PA919&dq=#v=onepage&q&f=false\", \"publisher\": \"Lippincott Williams & Wilkins\", \"isbn\": \"978-0-683-03421-9\"}{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.triathlon.org/images/uploads/ituevents_competition-rules-2010_2010-02-11.pdf\", \"title\": \"ITU Competition Rules\", \"date\": \"23 January 2010\", \"publisher\": \"International Triathlon Union\"} This places an emphasis on running performance as several athletes will enter the bike to run transition at the same time due to drafting.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"2004\", \"title\": \"The Triathlete's Training Bible\", \"publisher\": \"VeloPress\", \"isbn\": \"978-1-931382-42-7\", \"last\": \"Friel\", \"first\": \"Joe\"}\nTriathlon bicycles are generally optimized for aerodynamics, having special handlebars called aero-bars or tri-bars, aerodynamic wheels, and other components. Triathlon bikes use a specialized geometry, including a steep seat-tube angle both to improve aerodynamics and to spare muscle groups needed for running (see also triathlon equipment). At the end of the bike segment, triathletes also often cycle with a higher cadence (revolutions per minute), which serves in part to keep the muscles loose and flexible for running.\n\nRunning\nThe primary distinguishing feature of running in a triathlon is that it occurs after the athlete has already been exercising in two other disciplines for an extended period of time, so many muscles are already tired. The effect of switching from cycling to running can be profound; first-time triathletes are often astonished at their muscle weakness, which may be caused by lactate accumulation and the bizarre, sometimes painful sensation in their thighs a few hundred yards into the run, and discover that they run at a much slower pace than they are accustomed to in training. Triathletes train for this phenomenon through transition workouts known as \"bricks\": back-to-back workouts involving two disciplines, most commonly cycling and running.\n\nTransition\nThe change over from sport to sport takes place in a designated transition area. The transition provides a staging area where bicycles, running shoes, hydration and other gear is set up ready to be used during the course of the event. The first transition, known as T1, is between the swim-to-bike segments of the race. The second transition,  T2, is between the bike-to-run segments. Most events have one common transition area for both T1 and T2, while some point to point events have two separate transition areas.
