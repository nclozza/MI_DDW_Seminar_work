    "content": "Grasstrack\nMotorcycle Grasstrack is a form of motorcycle racing which typically, in its current form,  takes place on a flat track consisting of two straights and two bends usually constructed in a field.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.speedwaychampions.com/grass-track-champions.php\", \"title\": \"Grasstrack Champions\", \"publisher\": \"speedwaychampions.com\", \"accessdate\": \"20 March 2017\"}{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://grasstrackgb.co.uk\", \"title\": \"Grasstrack GB\", \"publisher\": \"grasstrackgb.co.uk\", \"accessdate\": \"20 March 2017\"} It is one of the oldest types of motorcycle sports in the UK with the first meetings having taken place in the 1920s.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.speedwaychampions.com/grass-track-champions.php\", \"title\": \"Grasstrack Champions\", \"publisher\": \"speedwaychampions.com\", \"accessdate\": \"20 March 2017\"}\n\nHistory\nIn the United Kingdom, kidney-shaped circuits were sometimes used to include a right hand bend, and undulating hillsides were also used to increase the challenge for riders.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.speedwaychampions.com/grass-track-champions.php\", \"title\": \"Grasstrack Champions\", \"publisher\": \"speedwaychampions.com\", \"accessdate\": \"20 March 2017\"} The events traditionally occurred after haymaking and before harvesting season on newly-cut fields.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.speedwaychampions.com/grass-track-champions.php\", \"title\": \"Grasstrack Champions\", \"publisher\": \"speedwaychampions.com\", \"accessdate\": \"20 March 2017\"} Postwar grasstrack circuits included \"permanent\" venues such as Brands Hatch and Mallory Park which were not simple oval shapes, although solo motorcycle races were run in an anti-clockwise direction. Later, these were converted into tarmac circuits with races using the more common clockwise direction associated with modern roadracing. \nIn the modern era, it is generally similar to Speedway with races usually taking place over 4 laps from a standing start. Unlike Speedway, which has 4 riders per race, Grasstrack racing can have many riders in each heat and the circuit is normally longer allowing higher speeds. Grasstrack has three solo classes, 250\u00a0cc, 350\u00a0cc and 500\u00a0cc together with three sidecar classes; left-handed 500\u00a0cc and 1000\u00a0cc (turning left) and right-handed 1000\u00a0cc (turning right).\nThe British Grasstrack season usually starts in early spring around the Easter holidays and runs through the summer/autumn months. More spectacular racing takes place at larger roped tracks including the Poacher and ASTRA Champion of Champions and Grand Slam meetings in Kent and in particular the most exciting meeting of all at the famous Rhodes Minnis circuit. \nThe pinnacle of the domestic Grasstrack season is the British Masters Championships. This official ACU championship is where the British champion is crowned in the mainstream 500\u00a0cc solo and 1000\u00a0cc right hand sidecar classes. Many famous Speedway riders such as 1976 world champion Peter Collins started their racing careers in Grasstrack. Some Speedway riders continue to take part in national Grasstrack meetings when their schedule permits. Grand Prix road racers John Surtees and Gary Hocking also began their racing careers in grass track competitions.[3]{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.ozebook.com/gpwin/hocking.htm\", \"title\": \"Gary Hocking\", \"publisher\": \"ozebook.com\", \"accessdate\": \"20 March 2017\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20140908064547/http://www.ozebook.com/gpwin/hocking.htm\", \"archivedate\": \"8 September 2014\"} Other competitors from the postwar era included now-famous names such as Bernie Ecclestone and Murray Walker.\nIn Europe the same sport is often called Long Track racing.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.speedwaychampions.com/long-track-champions.php\", \"title\": \"Long Track Champions\", \"publisher\": \"speedwaychampions.com\", \"accessdate\": \"20 March 2017\"} This is exactly the same setup as British grasstrack which has tracks normally around 600\u2013800 meters in length, but is held on the continent with tracks up to 1000\u20131200 meters in length and with speeds reaching 90\u00a0mph \u2013 100\u00a0mph. The machinery used is the same as are the riders.\n\nGrasstrack Motorcycles\nGrasstrack racing motorcycles look quite similar to Speedway machines but there are different engine capacity limits for each class. In the UK there are classes for 250\u00a0cc (normally 2 stroke engines), 350\u00a0cc and 500\u00a0cc bikes (usually 4-stroke engines).{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.speedwaychampions.com/grass-track-champions.php\", \"title\": \"Grasstrack Champions\", \"publisher\": \"speedwaychampions.com\", \"accessdate\": \"20 March 2017\"} Unlike Speedway bikes which have no gears, Grasstrack bikes usually have a 2 speed gearbox.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.speedwaychampions.com/grass-track-champions.php\", \"title\": \"Grasstrack Champions\", \"publisher\": \"speedwaychampions.com\", \"accessdate\": \"20 March 2017\"} Both Speedway and Grasstrack bike have no brakes.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.speedwaychampions.com/grass-track-champions.php\", \"title\": \"Grasstrack Champions\", \"publisher\": \"speedwaychampions.com\", \"accessdate\": \"20 March 2017\"} The only other main difference is that speedway bikes have no rear suspension and are shorter in length, usually by around 10\u201312\u00a0inches.\nAlso there is a class called Pre-75. These are bikes that have been made before 1975. The three classes in Pre-75, are 250, 350 and 500\u00a0cc.\nAs well as solo racing, sidecar racing is also quite popular and often very spectacular. There are mainly three recognised classes, 500\u00a0cc (using solo 4-stoke engines) and two 1000\u00a0cc classes (using stock road bike engines). Again, they all run on methanol, and the 500\u00a0cc class and the 1000cc Lefthand sidecar class run anti-clockwise around the oval track, and the 1000\u00a0cc class clockwise. The reason behind the difference in direction is often asked, the main reason being the origin of each class. The 500cc sidecars having been developed in mainland Europe, where drivers drive on the right of the road. The 1000cc sidecar has been developed in the UK where road users drive on the left. Therefore, the sidecar wheel is always found on the nearside of the vehicle.\nThe fastest recorded oval lap record is held by UK's Kelvin Tatum MBE at Rastede (1000\u00a0m Grass/Sand surface) in Germany at an average speed of 144.31\u00a0km/h.\n\nJunior Grasstrack racing\nRiders can start in Grasstrack racing at a young age (6 years old in the UK). Junior Grasstrack clubs cater for riders with motocross bikes as well as Grasstrack machines.\n\nOrganisation\nWhilst there are several Grasstrack racing clubs in the UK, the sport is regulated by the governing body of British motorcycle sport, the Auto Cycle Union (ACU) who organise an annual British championship.\n\nBritish Championships\nThe British Grasstrack Championships take place at two separate events. The 250\u00a0cc and 350\u00a0cc solo, 500\u00a0cc sidecar and 1000\u00a0cc Left Hand sidecar championships take place at the ACU British National Championships. The 500\u00a0cc Solos and 1000\u00a0cc Right Hand Sidecar Champions are decided at the ACU British Masters Championships. Qualification for the National Championships are by way of a National Gradings List. There is a British Masters Qualifying event held to determine qualification for the British Masters Final event.\nThe current ACU British Champions are Zach Wajtknecht (250\u00a0cc Solo), Tom Perry (350\u00a0cc Solo) James Shanes(500\u00a0cc Solo), Josh Goodwin/Liam Brown (500\u00a0cc Sidecar), Richard Webb/Jake Pope (1000\u00a0cc Left Hand Sidecar) and Rod Winterburn/Billy Winterburn (1000\u00a0cc Right Hand Sidecar). The ACU British Under 21 Champion is Luke Harris.\nThe British Championships are important events, particularly for 500\u00a0cc solo and 500\u00a0cc sidecar riders. The results of the championships determine who is to represent the nation on an international level for the FIM World Longtrack Championships and the UEM European Sidecar Championships. More recently a World Championship has emerged for 1000\u00a0cc Right Hand sidecars. Qualification is determined on results from both the British Masters event and the British Sidecar Speedway Championships. Many 500\u00a0cc solo riders race Grasstrack for their profession, therefore a good result in the British Masters is essential.\n\nList of British Grasstrack Champions{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.speedwaychampions.com/grass-track-champions.php\", \"title\": \"Grasstrack Champions\", \"publisher\": \"speedwaychampions.com\", \"accessdate\": \"20 March 2017\"}\nGlenn Cunningham (shared)\nGary Jackson/Carl Pugh (shared)\nThe British Sand Ace Championship takes place on Guernsey. The current champions are Zach Wajtknecht and Rod Winterburn & Billy Winterburn.\n\nEuropean and World Championships\nThe FIM, the World's motorcycle racing authority run a World Longtrack series as well as a World Team Cup. Although both events are named 'Longtrack', they often are competed for on Grass. The World Longtrack series competitors must qualify through a series of Qualifiers. Riders must be selected by their nations motorcycling authority. Riders then must compete in Qualifying rounds and hotly contested Semi Finals before reaching the World Longtrack series proper. The World Team Cup involves each team consisting of 3 riders racing each other for points. The top team at the end is the winner. Great Britain \nare the current World Team Cup Champions.\nThe UEM hold a European Grasstrack championship, where qualification is similar to the World Longtrack. However, the competition culminates in a one-day event. The UEM also holds a European Championship for sidecar competitors. 500\u00a0cc sidecar machines from several countries compete in 2 semi finals, and the championship is decided on a one-day final.\n\nList of World Longtrack Champions\nWorld Individual Championship (1957-1970)\n",
