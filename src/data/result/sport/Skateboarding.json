This was called \"sidewalk surfing\" \u2013 a new wave of surfing on the sidewalk as the sport of surfing became highly popular. No one knows who made the first board; it seems that several people came up with similar ideas at around the same time. The first manufactured skateboards were ordered by a Los Angeles, California surf shop, meant to be used by surfers in their downtime. The shop owner, Bill Richard, made a deal with the Chicago Roller Skate Company to produce sets of skate wheels, which they attached to square wooden boards. Accordingly, skateboarding was originally denoted \"sidewalk surfing\" and early skaters emulated surfing style and maneuvers, and performed barefoot.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"last2\": \"Grggi\", \"first2\": \"Lucia\", \"year\": \"2011\", \"title\": \"The Skateboard: The Good, the Rad, and the Gnarly: An Illustrated History\", \"url\": \"https://books.google.com/books?id=NxembYuScL8C\", \"publisher\": \"MVP Book\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20150320011028/http://books.google.com/books?id=NxembYuScL8C\", \"archivedate\": \"March 20, 2015\", \"accessdate\": \"October 26, 2012\", \"last\": \"Marcus\", \"first\": \"Ben\"}{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"last \": \"Borden\", \"first \": \"Iain\", \"title \": \"Skateboarding and the City: a Complete History\", \"publisher \": \"Bloomsbery\", \"year \": \"2019\", \"url \": \"https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&ei=b4j1W9eyHqvOgAaGk7HAAQ&q=borden+skateboarding+and+the+city+bloomsbury&oq=borden+skateboarding+and+the+city+bloomsbury\"}{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"last \": \"Weyland\", \"first \": \"Jocko\", \"title \": \"The Answer Is Never: A Skateboarder's History of the World\", \"publisher \": \"Grove Press\", \"year \": \"2002\", \"url \": \"https://books.google.com/books?id=O5dvdvyuTOkC&pg=PA21\", \"accessdate \": \"November 10, 2012\", \"archiveurl \": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20150320012653/http://books.google.com/books?id=O5dvdvyuTOkC&pg=PA21\", \"archivedate \": \"March 20, 2015\"}\nBy the 1960s a small number of surfing manufacturers in Southern California such as Jack's, Kips', Hobie, Bing's and Makaha started building skateboards that resembled small surfboards, and assembled teams to promote their products.

By 1966 a variety of sources began to claim that skateboarding was dangerous, resulting in shops being reluctant to sell them, and parents being reluctant to buy them. In 1966 sales had dropped significantly (ibid) and Skateboarder Magazine had stopped publication. The popularity of skateboarding dropped and remained low until the early 1970s.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://skateboard.about.com/cs/boardscience/a/brief_history.htm\", \"title\": \"Skateboarding: A Brief History (page 1)\", \"accessdate\": \"September 1, 2007\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://www.webcitation.org/65kUrTV8N?url=http://skateboard.about.com/cs/boardscience/a/brief_history.htm\", \"archivedate\": \"February 26, 2012\"}{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.skatelog.com/skateboarding/skateboarding-history.htm\", \"title\": \"Skateboarding History\", \"accessdate\": \"September 2, 2007\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://www.webcitation.org/65kUrxxga?url=http://www.skatelog.com/skateboarding/skateboarding-history.htm\", \"archivedate\": \"February 26, 2012\"}{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"title \": \"Jim Fitzpatrick Interview\", \"publisher \": \"I Skate Therefore I Am\", \"date \": \"January 6, 2011\", \"url \": \"http://blog.istia.tv/2011/01/jim-fitzpatrick-interview-part-ii-1957.html\", \"accessdate \": \"November 10, 2012\", \"archiveurl \": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20121116232821/http://blog.istia.tv/2011/01/jim-fitzpatrick-interview-part-ii-1957.html\", \"archivedate \": \"November 16, 2012\"}\n\n1970s\n\nIn the early 1970s, Frank Nasworthy started to develop a skateboard wheel made of polyurethane, calling his company Cadillac Wheels.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://skateboard.about.com/cs/boardscience/a/brief_history.htm\", \"title\": \"Skateboarding: A Brief History (page 1)\", \"accessdate\": \"September 1, 2007\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://www.webcitation.org/65kUrTV8N?url=http://skateboard.about.com/cs/boardscience/a/brief_history.htm\", \"archivedate\": \"February 26, 2012\"} Prior to this new material, skateboards wheels were metal or \"clay\" wheels. The improvement in traction and performance was so immense that from the wheel's release in 1972 the popularity of skateboarding started to rise rapidly again, causing companies to invest more in product development. Nasworthy commissioned artist Jim Evans to do a series of paintings promoting Cadillac Wheels, they were featured as ads and posters in the resurrected Skateboarder magazine, and proved immensely popular in promoting the new style of skateboarding.\nIn the early 1970s skateparks hadn't been invented yet, so skateboarders would flock and skateboard in such urban places as The Escondido reservoir in San Diego, California. Skateboarding magazine would publish the location and Skateboarders made up nicknames for each location such as the Tea Bowl, the Fruit Bowl, Bellagio, the Rabbit Hole, Bird Bath, the Egg Bowl, Upland Pool and the Sewer Slide. Some of the development concepts in the terrain of skateparks were actually taken from the Escondido reservoir.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"2008\", \"title\": \"Stalefish: Skateboard Culture from the Rejects Who Made It\", \"url\": \"https://books.google.com/books/about/Stalefish.html?id=HVKTyRW-MSkC\", \"publisher\": \"Chronicle Books\", \"isbn\": \"9780811860420\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20150319235528/http://books.google.com/books/about/Stalefish.html?id=HVKTyRW-MSkC\", \"archivedate\": \"March 19, 2015\", \"accessdate\": \"November 3, 2012\", \"first\": \"Sean\", \"last\": \"Mortimer\"}{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url \": \"http://www.angelfire.com/ca3/peralta/iv.html\", \"title \": \"Stacy Peralta 1st SkateBoarder Magazine Interview\", \"publisher \": \"SkateBoarder Magazine\", \"date \": \"October 1976\", \"work \": \"Z-Boys.com\", \"accessdate \": \"November 3, 2012\", \"archiveurl \": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20141213112922/http://www.angelfire.com/ca3/peralta/iv.html\", \"archivedate \": \"December 13, 2014\"}{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url \": \"http://calstreets.com/gxp-retro-skaters/skateboard-history-vintage/2012-06-12-05-45-04/sims-corporation-2\", \"title \": \"Sims Contributions and Importance to Skateboarding\", \"author \": \"Ben Marcus\", \"publisher \": \"Calstreets\", \"date \": \"May 24, 2012\", \"accessdate \": \"November 5, 2012\", \"urlstatus \": \"dead\", \"archiveurl \": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20130617041510/http://calstreets.com/gxp-retro-skaters/skateboard-history-vintage/2012-06-12-05-45-04/sims-corporation-2\", \"archivedate \": \"June 17, 2013\"} Many companies started to manufacture trucks (axles) specially designed for skateboarding, reached in 1976 by Tracker Trucks.

A banana board is a skinny, flexible skateboard made of polypropylene with ribs on the underside for structural support.  These were very popular during the mid-1970s and were available in a myriad of colors, bright yellow probably being the most memorable, hence the name.\nIn 1975 skateboarding had risen back in popularity enough to have one of the largest skateboarding competitions since the 1960s, the Del Mar National Championships, which is said to have had up to 500 competitors.

Due to technology and safety concerns at the time, when many competitors crashed during their runs, the sport did not gain popularity or support during this time.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url \": \"http://articles.latimes.com/2007/nov/18/sports/sp-signalhill18\", \"title \": \"Board out of their minds\", \"author \": \"Mike Horelick\", \"date \": \"November 18, 2007\", \"work \": \"[[Los Angeles Times]]\", \"accessdate \": \"November 17, 2012\", \"archiveurl \": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20120622195909/http://articles.latimes.com/2007/nov/18/sports/sp-signalhill18\", \"archivedate \": \"June 22, 2012\"}{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url \": \"https://sports.yahoo.com/top/news?slug=ycn-8612409\", \"title \": \"vHistory of skateboard competitions 1960s to 1980s: A brief overview\", \"author1 \": \"Killeen Gonzalez\", \"date \": \"June 9, 2011\", \"work \": \"[[Yahoo]]\", \"accessdate \": \"November 17, 2012\", \"archiveurl \": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20140113025406/http://sports.yahoo.com/top/news?slug=ycn-8612409\", \"archivedate \": \"January 13, 2014\"}\nIn March 1976, Skateboard City skatepark in Port Orange, Florida and Carlsbad Skatepark in San Diego County, California would be the first two skateparks to be opened to the public, just a week apart.

The skateboarders took advantage of the improved handling of their skateboards and started inventing new tricks. Skateboarders, most notably Ty Page, Bruce Logan, Bobby Piercy, Kevin Reed, and the Z-Boys started to skate the vertical walls of swimming pools that were left empty in the 1976 California drought. This started the \"vert\" trend in skateboarding. With increased control, vert skaters could skate faster and perform more dangerous tricks, such as slash grinds and frontside/backside airs. This caused liability concerns and increased insurance costs to skatepark owners, and the development (first by Norcon, then more successfully by Rector) of improved knee pads that had a hard sliding cap and strong strapping proved to be too-little-too-late. During this era, the \"freestyle\" movement in skateboarding began to splinter off and develop into a much more specialized discipline, characterized by the development of a wide assortment of flat-ground tricks.\nAs a result of the \"vert\" skating movement, skate parks had to contend with high liability costs that led to many park closures. In response, vert skaters started making their own ramps, while freestyle skaters continued to evolve their flatland style. Thus, by the beginning of the 1980s, skateboarding had once again declined in popularity.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.skatelog.com/skateboarding/skateboarding-history.htm\", \"title\": \"Skateboarding History\", \"accessdate\": \"September 2, 2007\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://www.webcitation.org/65kUrxxga?url=http://www.skatelog.com/skateboarding/skateboarding-history.htm\", \"archivedate\": \"February 26, 2012\"}\n\n1980s\nThis period was fueled by skateboard companies that were run by skateboarders. The focus was initially on vert ramp skateboarding. The invention of the no-hands aerial (later known as the ollie) by Alan Gelfand in Florida in 1976,{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://skateboarding.transworld.net/1000009436/features/gasbag/\", \"title\": \"GASBAG\", \"date\": \"October 11, 2005\", \"publisher\": \"Bonnier Corporation\", \"accessdate\": \"August 17, 2012\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20130120134852/http://skateboarding.transworld.net/1000009436/features/gasbag/\", \"archivedate\": \"January 20, 2013\", \"work\": \"Transworld Skateboarding\", \"author\": \"Transworld\"} and the almost parallel development of the grabbed aerial by George Orton and Tony Alva in California, made it possible for skaters to perform airs on vertical ramps. While this wave of skateboarding was sparked by commercialized vert ramp skating, a majority of people who skateboarded during this period didn't ride vert ramps. As most people could not afford to build vert ramps, or did not have access to nearby ramps, street skating increased in popularity.\nFreestyle skating remained healthy throughout this period, with pioneers such as Rodney Mullen inventing many of the basic tricks that would become the foundation of modern street skating, such as the \"Impossible\" and the \"kickflip\". The influence that freestyle exerted upon street skating became apparent during the mid-1980s; however, street skating was still performed on wide vert boards with short noses, slide rails, and large soft wheels. In response to the tensions created by this confluence of skateboarding \"genres\", a rapid evolution occurred in the late 1980s to accommodate the street skater. Since few skateparks were available to skaters at this time, street skating pushed skaters to seek out shopping centers and public and private property as their \"spot\" to skate. (Public opposition, in which businesses, governments, and property owners have banned skateboarding on properties under their jurisdiction or ownership, would progressively intensify over the following decades.){\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://honors.usf.edu/documents/Thesis/U69703351.pdf\", \"title\": \"Skate For Life: An Analysis of the Skateboarding Subculture\", \"publisher\": \"USF University of South Florida\", \"format\": \"PDF\", \"accessdate\": \"August 17, 2012\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20130120134855/http://honors.usf.edu/documents/Thesis/U69703351.pdf\", \"archivedate\": \"January 20, 2013\", \"work\": \"Skate For Life: An Analysis of the Skateboarding Subculture (Honors Thesis)\", \"author\": \"Thomas Slee\"}{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://bss.sfsu.edu/urbanaction/ua2001/ps2.html\", \"title\": \"The Poetics of Security:  Skateboarding, Urban Design, and the New Public Space{{!}}1\", \"year\": \"2001\", \"publisher\": \"San Francisco State University\", \"accessdate\": \"August 17, 2012\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20120724004733/http://bss.sfsu.edu/urbanaction/ua2001/ps2.html\", \"archivedate\": \"July 24, 2012\", \"work\": \"Urban Action 2001\", \"author\": \"Ocean Howell\"} By 1992, only a small fraction of skateboarders continuing to take part in a highly technical version of street skating, combined with the decline of vert skating, produced a sport that lacked the mainstream appeal to attract new skaters.\nDuring this period, numerous skateboarders - as well as companies in the industry - paid tribute to the scenes of Marty McFly skateboarding in the film Back to the Future for its influence in this regard. Examples can be seen in promotional material, in interviews in which professional skateboarders cite the film as an initiation into the action sport, and in the public's recognition of the film's influence.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.rogerskateboards.com/welcome-back-to-the-future-of-radical/\", \"title\": \"Welcome Back to the Future Of Radical\", \"date\": \"June 23, 2012\", \"publisher\": \"Roger Skateboards\", \"accessdate\": \"August 24, 2012\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20130511170150/http://www.rogerskateboards.com/welcome-back-to-the-future-of-radical/\", \"author\": \"Michael Sieben\", \"author2\": \"Stacey Lowery\"}{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"October 26, 2010\", \"title\": \"Going 'Back to the Future,' 25 years later\", \"url\": \"http://edition.cnn.com/2010/SHOWBIZ/Movies/10/20/bttf.anniversary.go/index.html\", \"work\": \"CNN Cable News Network\", \"publisher\": \"Turner Broadcasting System, Inc\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20140222230003/http://edition.cnn.com/2010/SHOWBIZ/Movies/10/20/bttf.anniversary.go/index.html\", \"archivedate\": \"February 22, 2014\", \"accessdate\": \"August 24, 2012\", \"author\": \"Henry Hanks\"}\n\n1990s\nSkateboarding during the 1990s became dominated by street skateboarding. Most boards are about 7\u00a01\u20444 to 8 inches (180 to 200\u00a0mm) wide and 30 to 32 inches (760 to 810\u00a0mm) long. The wheels are made of an extremely hard polyurethane, with hardness (durometer) approximately 99A. The wheel sizes are relatively small so that the boards are lighter, and the wheels' inertia is overcome quicker, thus making tricks more manageable. Board styles have changed dramatically since the 1970s but have remained mostly alike since the mid-1990s. The contemporary shape of the skateboard is derived from the freestyle boards of the 1980s with a largely symmetrical shape and relatively narrow width. This form had become standard by the mid '90s.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.skateboardexpress.com.au/freestyle/\", \"title\": \"HOME FREESTYLE Freestyle\", \"publisher\": \"Skateboard

Many skaters ride barefoot, particularly in summer and in warmer countries, such as South Africa, Australia, Spain and South America. The plastic penny board is intended to be ridden barefoot, as is the surfboard-inspired hamboard.\nIn the 2010s, electric skateboards became popular, along with self-balancing unicycles in a board format.\nThe sport of skateboarding will make its olympic debut at the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games, with both men's and women's events. Competition will take place in two disciplines: street and park.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://tokyo2020.org/en/games/sport/olympic/skateboarding/\", \"title\": \"Skateboarding\", \"website\": \"Tokyo 2020\", \"accessdate\": \"21 August 2019\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20190820112434/https://tokyo2020.org/en/games/sport/olympic/skateboarding/\", \"archivedate\": \"20 August 2019\"}\n\nTrick skating\nWith the evolution of skateparks and ramp skating, the skateboard began to change. Early skate tricks had consisted mainly of two-dimensional freestyle manoeuvres like riding on only two wheels (\"wheelie\" or \"manual\"), spinning only on the back wheels (a \"pivot\"), high jumping over a bar and landing on the board again, also known as a \"hippie jump\", long jumping from one board to another, (often over small barrels or fearless teenagers), or slalom. Another popular trick was the Bertlemann slide, named after Larry Bertelemann's surfing manoeuvres.\nIn 1976, skateboarding was transformed by the invention of the ollie by Alan \"Ollie\" Gelfand. It remained largely a unique Florida trick until the summer of 1978, when Gelfand made his first visit to California. Gelfand and his revolutionary maneuvers caught the attention of the West Coast skaters and the media where it began to spread worldwide. The ollie was adapted to flat ground by Rodney Mullen in 1982. Mullen also invented the \"Magic Flip,\" which was later renamed the kickflip, as well as many other tricks including, the 360 Kickflip, which is a 360 pop shove-it and a kickflip in the same motion. The flat ground ollie allowed skateboarders to perform tricks in mid-air without any more equipment than the skateboard itself, it has formed the basis of many street skating tricks.  A recent development in the world of trick skating is the 1080, which was first ever landed by Tom Schaar in 2012.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.skateboarding.com.au/news/12-year-old-lands-first-ever-1080-skateboard/\", \"title\": \"12 year old lands the first ever 1080 on a skateboard\", \"date\": \"July 3, 2012\", \"publisher\": \"Skateboarding.com.au\", \"accessdate\": \"October 7, 2012\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20121215175336/http://www.skateboarding.com.au/news/12-year-old-lands-first-ever-1080-skateboard/\", \"archivedate\": \"December 15, 2012\"}{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.redbull.com/cs/Satellite/en_INT/Video/tom-schaar-first-ever-1080-video-021243187489113\", \"title\": \"12-year-old skateboarder nails first ever 1080\", \"date\": \"March 30, 2012\", \"publisher\": \"Red Bull\", \"format\": \"video\", \"accessdate\": \"April 3, 2012\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20120501095403/http://www.redbull.com/cs/Satellite/en_INT/Video/tom-schaar-first-ever-1080-video-021243187489113\", \"archivedate\": \"May 1, 2012\"}\n\nCulture\nSkateboarding was popularized by the 1986 skateboarding cult classic Thrashin'. Directed by David Winters and starring Josh Brolin, it features appearances from many famous skaters such as Tony Alva, Tony Hawk, Christian Hosoi and Steve Caballero. Thrashin' also had a direct impact on Lords of Dogtown, as Catherine Hardwicke, who directed Lords of Dogtown, was hired by Winters to work on Thrashin' as a production designer where she met, worked with and befriended many famous skaters including the real Tony Alva, Tony Hawk, Christian Hosoi and Steve Caballero.\nThese films have helped improve the reputation of skateboarding youth, depicting individuals of this subculture as having a positive outlook on life, prone to poking harmless fun at each other, and engaging in healthy sportsman's competition. According to the film, lack of respect, egotism and hostility towards fellow skateboarders is generally frowned upon, albeit each of the characters (and as such, proxies of the \"stereotypical\" skateboarder) have a firm disrespect for authority and for rules in general. Gleaming the Cube, a 1989 movie starring Christian Slater as a skateboarding teen investigating the death of his adopted Vietnamese brother, was somewhat of an iconic landmark to the skateboarding genre of the era.[citation needed] Many well-known skaters had cameos in the film, including Tony Hawk and Rodney Mullen, where Mullen served as Slater's stunt double.\nSkateboarding was, at first, tied to the culture of surfing. As skateboarding spread across the United States to places unfamiliar with surfing or surfing culture, it developed an image of its own. For example, the classic film short Video Days (1991) portrayed skateboarders as reckless rebels.\nCalifornia duo Jan and Dean recorded the song \"Sidewalk Surfin'\" in 1964, which is the Beach Boys song \"Catch a Wave\" with new lyrics associated with skateboarding.\nCertain cities still oppose the building of skate parks in their neighborhoods, for fear of increased crime and drugs in the area. The rift between the old image of skateboarding and a newer one is quite visible: magazines such as Thrasher portray skateboarding as dirty, rebellious, and still firmly tied to punk, while other publications, Transworld Skateboarding as an example, paint a more diverse and controlled picture of skateboarding. As more professional skaters use hip hop, reggae, or hard rock music accompaniment in their videos, many urban youths, hip-hop fans, reggae fans, and hard rock fans are also drawn to skateboarding, further diluting the sport's punk image.\nGroup spirit supposedly influences the members of this community. In presentations of this sort, showcasing of criminal tendencies is absent, and no attempt is made to tie extreme sports to any kind of illegal activity. Female based skateboarding groups also exist, such as Brujas which is based in New York City. Many women use their participation in skate crews to perform an alternative form of femininity.{\"citetype\": \"journal\", \"date\": \"August 2005\", \"title\": \"Skater girlhood and emphasized femininity: 'you can't land an ollie properly in heels'\", \"journal\": \"Gender and Education\", \"volume\": \"17\", \"pages\": \"229\\u2013248\", \"last\": \"Kelly\", \"first\": \"Deirdre\"} These female skate crews offer a safe haven for women and girls in cities, where they can skate and bond without male expectations or competition.\nThe increasing availability of technology is apparent within the skateboarding community. Many skateboarders record and edit videos of themselves and friends skateboarding.

Using the bounce of the trampoline gives height to perform tricks, whereas in skateboarding you need to make the height by performing an ollie. Trampboarding is seen on YouTube in numerous videos.[citation needed]\n\nSwing boarding\nSwing boarding is the activity where a skateboard deck is suspended from a pivot point above the rider which allows the rider to swing about that pivot point. The board swings in an arc which is a similar movement to riding a half pipe. The incorporation of a harness and frame allows the rider to perform turns and spins all while flying through the air.\n\nControversy\nSkateboarding damages urban terrain features such as curbs, benches, and ledges when skateboarders perform \"grinds\" and other tricks on these surfaces.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/06/how-cities-use-design-to-drive-homeless-people-away/373067/\", \"title\": \"How Cities Use Design to Drive Homeless People Away: Saying &quot;you're not welcome here&quot;\\u2014with spikes\", \"last\": \"Rosenberger\", \"first\": \"Robert\", \"date\": \"June 19, 2014\", \"publisher\": \"The Atlantic Monthly Group\", \"accessdate\": \"April 23, 2017\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20140701135734/http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/06/how-cities-use-design-to-drive-homeless-people-away/373067/\", \"archivedate\": \"July 1, 2014\", \"work\": \"The Atlantic\"}  Private industry has responded to this problem by using skate deterrent devices, such as the Skatestopper, in efforts to prevent further damage and to reduce skateboarding on these surfaces.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/06/how-cities-use-design-to-drive-homeless-people-away/373067/\", \"title\": \"How Cities Use Design to Drive Homeless People Away: Saying &quot;you're not welcome here&quot;\\u2014with spikes\", \"last\": \"Rosenberger\", \"first\": \"Robert\", \"date\": \"June 19, 2014\", \"publisher\": \"The Atlantic Monthly Group\", \"accessdate\": \"April 23, 2017\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20140701135734/http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/06/how-cities-use-design-to-drive-homeless-people-away/373067/\", \"archivedate\": \"July 1, 2014\", \"work\": \"The Atlantic\"}\nThe enactment of ordinances and the posting of signs stating \"Skateboarding is not allowed\" have also become common methods to discourage skateboarding in public areas in many cities, to protect pedestrians and property.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"last \": \"Borden\", \"first \": \"Iain\", \"title \": \"Skateboarding and the City: a Complete History\", \"publisher \": \"Bloomsbery\", \"year \": \"2019\", \"url \": \"https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&ei=b4j1W9eyHqvOgAaGk7HAAQ&q=borden+skateboarding+and+the+city+bloomsbury&oq=borden+skateboarding+and+the+city+bloomsbury\"}{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"url \": \"http://www.newsreview.com/sacramento/skateboarding-is-not-a-sport/content?oid=44507\", \"title \": \"Skateboarding is not a sport: Skateboarding the Sacramento streets takes skill, balance and nerve.
