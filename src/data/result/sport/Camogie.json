Camogie is played by 100,000 women in Ireland and worldwide, largely among Irish communities.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"last \": \"Moran\", \"first \": \"Mary\", \"authorlink \": \"Mary Moran (camogie)\", \"title \": \"A Game of Our Own: The History of Camogie\", \"publisher \": \"Cumann Cam\\u00f3ga\\u00edochta\", \"year \": \"2011\", \"location \": \"Dublin, Ireland\"}{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"last \": \"Arlott\", \"first \": \"John\", \"title \": \"Oxford Companion to Sports and Games\", \"publisher \": \"Flamingo\", \"year \": \"1977\", \"location \": \"London, England\"}\nA variant of the game of hurling (which is played by men only) adapted to suit women, it is organised by the Dublin-based Camogie Association or An Cumann Cam\u00f3ga\u00edochta.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.camogie.ie/about-camogie.asp\", \"title\": \"The Camogie Association : About Camogie\", \"last\": \"Vuepoint.ie\", \"website\": \"Camogie.ie\", \"language\": \"en\"}{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.gaa.ie/my-gaa/getting-involved/camogie\", \"title\": \"GAA.ie\", \"website\": \"Gaa.ie\", \"language\": \"en\"} Camogie has none of the physical drama found in hurling.[5] The annual All Ireland Camogie Championship has a record attendance of 33,154,[6] while average attendances in recent years are in the region of 15,000 to 18,000. The final is broadcast live, with a TV audience of as many as over 300,000 being claimed.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"last \": \"[[Eoghan Corry|Corry]]\", \"first \": \"Eoghan\", \"title \": \"Illustrated History of the GAA\", \"publisher \": \"Gill & MacMillan\", \"year \": \"2005\", \"location \": \"Dublin, Ireland\"}\nUNESCO lists Camogie as an element of Intangible Cultural Heritage.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://ich.unesco.org/en/RL/hurling-01263\", \"title\": \"Hurling - intangible heritage - Culture Sector - UNESCO\", \"website\": \"ich.unesco.org\", \"language\": \"en\"} The game is referenced in Waiting for Godot by Irish playwright Samuel Beckett.\n\nGame & rules\nThe game consists of two thirty-minute halves. There is a half-time interval of 10 minutes. In event of extra time, halves must consist of 10 minutes each. Each team has 15 players on the field. Within the 15 players the team must consist of one goalkeeper, three full back players, three half back players, two centre-field players, three half forward players and three full forward players. There is a minimum requirement of 12 players on the pitch at all times.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.camogie.ie/files/Administration+Section/Playing+Rules+2014.pdf\", \"title\": \"Archived copy\", \"accessdate\": \"2018-01-15\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20180116004430/http://www.camogie.ie/files/Administration+Section/Playing+Rules+2014.pdf\", \"archivedate\": \"16 January 2018\"} The rules are almost identical to hurling, with a few exceptions.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.camogie.ie/AboutCamogie/CamogievHurlingRuleDifferences/tabid/60/Default.aspx\", \"title\": \"Rule Differences on Camogie.ie website\"}\nCamogie players must wear skirts or skorts rather than shorts.\nUnder the original 1903 rules both the match and the field were shorter than their hurling equivalents. Matches were 40 minutes, increased to 50 minutes in 1934, and playing fields 125\u2013130 yards (114-119m) long and 65\u201370 yards (59-64m) wide. From 1929 until 1979 a second crossbar, a \"points bar\" was also used, meaning that a point would not be allowed if it travelled over this bar, a somewhat contentious rule through the 75 years it was in use. Teams were regulated at 12 a side, using an elliptical formation, although it was more a \"squeezed lemon\" formation with the three midfield players grouped more closely together than their counterpart on the half back and half-forward lines. In 1999 camogie moved to the GAA field-size and 15-a-side, adopting the standard GAA butterfly formation.\n\nField and equipment\nThe field is not of a fixed size, but must be between 130m long by 80m wide, and 145m long by 90m wide. \n\nGoals and scoring\nH-shaped goals are used. A team achieves a score by making the ball go between the posts. If the ball goes over the bar for a \"point\", the team earns one point. If the ball goes under the bar for a \"goal\", the team earns three points.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.camogie.ie/AboutCamogie/CamogiePlayingRules/tabid/59/Default.aspx\", \"title\": \"Rules of Camogie on Camogie.ie website\"}\n\nFoundation\nThe name was invented by Tadhg Ua Donnchadha (T\u00f3rna) at meetings in 1903 in advance of the first matches in 1904.\n{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"last \": \"Puirs\\u00e9il\", \"first \": \"P\\u00e1draig\", \"title \": \"Sc\\u00e9al na Cam\\u00f3ga\\u00edochta\", \"publisher \": \"[[Camogie Association of Ireland|Cumann Cam\\u00f3ga\\u00edochta na nGael]]\", \"year \": \"1984\", \"location \": \"Dublin, Ireland\"} It is derived from stick used in the game. Men play hurling using a curved stick called a cam\u00e1n in Irish. Women in the early camogie games used a shorter stick described by the diminutive form cam\u00f3g. The suffix -a\u00edocht (originally \"uidheacht\") was added to both words to give names for the sports: cam\u00e1na\u00edocht (which became iom\u00e1na\u00edocht) and cam\u00f3ga\u00edocht. When the Gaelic Athletic Association was founded in 1884 the English-origin name \"hurling\" was given to the men's game. When an organisation for women was set up in 1904, it was decided to anglicise the Irish name cam\u00f3ga\u00edocht to camogie.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"last \": \"Moran\", \"first \": \"Mary\", \"authorlink \": \"Mary Moran (camogie)\", \"title \": \"A Game of Our Own: The History of Camogie\", \"publisher \": \"Cumann Cam\\u00f3ga\\u00edochta\", \"year \": \"2011\", \"location \": \"Dublin, Ireland\"}\nThe experimental rules were drawn up for the female game by M\u00e1ire N\u00ed Chinn\u00e9ide, Se\u00e1n (Sceilg) \u00d3 Ceallaigh, Tadhg \u00d3 Donnchadha and S\u00e9amus \u00d3 Braon\u00e1in. The Official Launch of Camogie took place with the first public match between Craobh an Ch\u00e9itinnigh (Keatings branch of the Gaelic League) and C\u00fachulainns on 17 July at a Feis in Navan. The sport's governing body, the Camogie Association or An Cumann Cam\u00f3ga\u00edochta was founded in 1905 and re-constituted in 1911, 1923 and 1939. Until June 2010 it was known as Cumann Cam\u00f3ga\u00edochta na nGael.\nM\u00e1ire N\u00ed Chinn\u00e9ide and C\u00e1it N\u00ed Dhonnchadha, two prominent Irish-language enthusiasts and cultural nationalists, were credited with having created the sport, with the assistance of N\u00ed Dhonnchadha's scholarly brother Tadhg \u00d3 Donnchadha, who drew up its rules. Thus, although camogie was founded by women, and independently run (although closely linked to the GAA), there was, from the outset, a small yet powerful male presence within its administrative ranks. It was no surprise that camogie emanated from the Gaelic League, nor that it would be dependent upon the structures and networks provided by that organisation during the initial expansion of the sport. Of all the cultural nationalist organisations for adults that emerged during the fin de si\u00e8cle, the Gaelic League was the only one to accept female and male members on an equal footing.[14]\n\nLeagues\nAn Cumann Cam\u00f3ga\u00edochta has a similar structure to the Gaelic Athletic Association, with an Annual Congress every spring which decides on policy and major issues such as rule changes, and an executive council, the \u00c1rd Ch\u00f3mhairle which deals with short-term issues and governance. The game is administered from a headquarters in Croke Park in Dublin. Each of 28 county boards takes control of its own affairs (all of the Irish counties except Fermanagh, Leitrim and Sligo), with the number of clubs ranging from 58 in Cork to one in Leitrim. There are four provincial councils and affiliates in Asia, Australia, Britain, Europe, New York, New Zealand and North America.\n\nClubs\nThere are 537 camogie clubs, of which 513 (95.5%) are based on the island of Ireland, 47 in Connacht (8.8%), 195 in Leinster (36.4%), 160 in Munster (29.8%), and 110 in Ulster (20.5%).\n\nAll-Ireland Championship\nThe county is the unit of structure in elite competition, responsible for organising club competitions within the county unit and for fielding inter-county teams in the various grades of the All-Ireland championships and National Camogie League.\n\nNational League\nThe National League is staged during the winter-spring months, with four divisions of team graded by ability.\n\nProvincial championships\nProvincial championships take place at all levels, independent of the All Ireland series which has been run on an open draw basis since 1973.\n\nInternational and inter-provincial\nIreland plays a camogie-shinty international against Scotland each year. The Gael Linn Cup is an inter-provincial competition played at senior and junior level. The sport is closely associated with the Celtic Congress. Two former Camogie Association presidents M\u00e1ire N\u00ed Chinn\u00e9ide and Agnes O'Farrelly were also presidents of Celtic Congress and exhibition matches have been held at the Celtic Congress since 1938. The first such exhibition match, on the Isle of Man in 1938, marked the first appearance of Kathleen Cody, who became one of the stars of the 1940s.\n\nInter-collegiate\nThe Ashbourne and Purcell Cups and Father Meachair seven-a-side are the principal inter-collegiate competitions.\n\nSchools\nThere is also a programme of provincial and All Ireland championships at secondary schools senior and junior levels, differentiated by the years of secondary school cycle, with years 4\u20136 competing in the senior competition, and years 1\u20133 competing at junior level. Cumann na mBunscoil organises competitions at primary school level.\n\nF\u00e9ile na nGael\nCamogie competitions for club teams featuring under-14 players are played in four divisions as part of the annual F\u00e9ile na nGael festival. The county that is selected for a particular year, all their clubs host teams from all around the country representing their county. Host clubs get families to take in two or three children for a couple of days.\n\nRecords\nCork have won the most Camogie All-Ireland titles with 28, the last being in 2018.\nCork have won the most National Camogie League titles with 16.\n\nAwards\nCamogie All Stars Awards are awarded annually to the elite players who have performed best in each of the 15 positions on a traditional camogie team. Player of the year and other achievement awards have also been awarded to leading players for several decades.\n\nTeam of the Century\nPicked in 2004{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.camogie.ie/AboutCamogie/TeamoftheCentury/tabid/103/Default.aspx\", \"title\": \"Team of the century\", \"website\": \"Camogie.ie\"}\n",
