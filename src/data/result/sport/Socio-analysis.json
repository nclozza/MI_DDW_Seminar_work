From this conception are born methods of exploration which can increase capacities through making conscious what was unconscious for individuals, groups, and organisations, and through releasing energy and ideas that help create individual and organizational direction, and meaning.\nSocio-analysis has at its heart a query as to what is the psychological truth for an individual, group, organisation, or other social system, and how may this best be brought to light as a means for creative transformation and growth?\n\nSocio-analysis and wonder\nAnxiety, its exploration, and understanding are of central concern to psychoanalysis, which was founded to explore the mental problems of medical patients. While socio-analytic exploration frequently uncovers systemic pain, (of which anxiety is a part), the \u201cpain\u201d is a guide to transformation of the system as a whole with all its potentialities for growth. Joshua Bain has suggested that the emphasis on anxiety is limiting, and that a more appropriate paradigm for socio-analysis is wonder.[2] Wonder was regarded by Plato as the beginning of philosophy, and its link to exploration, creativity, and the growth of capacities of human beings, would seem to make it the appropriate starting point for socio-analysis  as well.[3]\n\u201cWonder is the special affection of a philosopher; for philosophy has no other starting point than this; and it is a happy genealogy which makes Iris the daughter of Thaumas\u201d. Theaetetus, 155D\nThe saying \u201cWhen wonder ceases, knowledge begins\u201d, which is attributed to\nSir Francis Bacon, is especially apt for socio-analysis with its emphasis on always explore, rather than sit tight on what is supposedly known.\n\nBrief history\nSocio-analysis has its roots in the first Northfield Experiment carried out by Wilfred Bion and John Rickman, and reported in the Lancet in 1943,[4] and later by Bion in the Bulletin of the Menninger Clinic in 1946.[5] Bion is generally regarded as the father of socio-analysis (although the word was not used in those days).\n\nWilfred Bion\nWilfred Bion was born in India in 1897 and educated at Bishop Stortford College in England. During the First World War he commanded a tank on the Western Front and was decorated for bravery: Distinguished Service Order, and the Legion of Honour. After studying History at Oxford University, and a stint teaching History at his old school, he began Medical training at University College Hospital in 1924 and qualified in 1930. He worked at the Tavistock Clinic in London before the Second World War, and started a personal psychoanalysis with John Rickman. After the Second World War he contributed to the formation of the Tavistock Institute.  He had a second psycho-analysis with Melanie Klein, and trained and qualified as a psychoanalyst. Bion was, and is, regarded by many people as a genius who made fundamental contributions to psychoanalysis, and to the understanding of groups. His stance of always pointing to the unknown, whether with a patient or with a group or in himself, was the realization of his genius.\n\nNorthfield experiments\nNorthfield Hospital was a military hospital, situated in Birmingham, in the English Midlands, with the task of treating soldiers who had developed psychiatric problems, in order to get them back into the war. Together with John Rickman, Wilfred Bion introduced group meetings as the principal method of change for these patients.[6][7] This Experiment, together with the Second Northfield Experiment associated with the innovations of S. H. Foulkes, Tom Main and Harold Bridger, contributed the following elements to the emerging discipline of socio-analysis:\n\nSocio-analytic role\nThe Northfield Experiments heralded a socio-analytic consultant role: one of exploration of individual, group, and organisational phenomena which are linked dynamically. The socio-analyst, as exemplified by the role Bion took at Northfield, and after the War in his group explorations at the Tavistock Clinic, works from a stance of \u201cnot knowing\u201d with the courage, and fortitude, to pursue psychological truth.\nThe socio-analyst, like the psychoanalyst, uses concepts such as the unconscious, defences, splitting, projection, projective identification, introjection, and transference, but the field for exploration, while including the individual, is wider than the psychoanalytic dyad \u2013 e.g. a group, an organisation, a society, global systems.\nThus, for example, the socio-analyst uses concepts of group and organisational transference, and pays particular attention to the way he/she is made to feel through client engagements, as a possible indication of unconscious dynamics within the client system.\n\nGroup relations theory and Tavistock conferences\nBion\u2019s exploration of group dynamics at the Tavistock Clinic in London after the war culminated in a seminal publication \u201cExperiences in Groups\u201d,[9] which describes and analyses three basic assumptions that can be observed in group behaviour at different times: basic assumption dependency, basic assumption fight / flight, and basic assumption pairing. Basic assumptions operate unconsciously within groups at the same time a group may be engaged in a conscious work task \u2013 that Bion called a W group.[10]\nThese insights of Bion together with theories of Kurt Lewin led to the first Group Relations Conference in 1957 that was sponsored by the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations and Leicester University, and directed by Eric Trist.[11]\nGroup Relations Conferences typically explore the effects of group and organisational dynamics on how individuals take up authority and leadership in this temporary institution, and in their work. The \u201cLeicester\u201d Conference as it came to be known under the leadership of A.K. Rice and colleagues such as Pierre Turquet, Eric Miller,{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"last1\": \"Erlich\", \"first1\": \"H.

The focus of social dreaming (unlike in psychoanalysis or dreaming groups) is not on the meaning of the dream for the individual dreamer, but regarding the dreams and associations as a way of exploring and making social meaning. Conferences to explore social dreaming have been held in Israel, the United States, Australia, India, and most European countries.\nUp until 1996 the work that has been described in this article went under different labels.[20] There was no one word that described the activities and the role. Alastair Bain suggested that the discipline should be called \u201cSocio-Analysis\u201d in 1996.\n\nOrganisations\nThe Australian Institute of Socio-Analysis pioneered a three-year professional training program in socio-analysis in 1999, and began publishing a Journal \u201cSocio-Analysis\u201d in 1999. While the Australian Institute of Socio-Analysis no longer exists the work of socio-analysis continues to be developed by the Centre for Socio-Analysis in Melbourne [1]. Other organisations which do socio-analytic or closely related work include the William Alanson White Institute in New York, the A.K. Rice Institute for the Study of Social Systems (AKRI) in the United States, the Tavistock Institute and Tavistock Clinic in London, the Grubb Institute [2] and OPUS [3], both in London, the Centre for Applied Research in Philadelphia, the International Society for the Psychoanalytic Study of Organisations [4], the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, the University of Wuppertal [5], and practitioners from many countries who work in the tradition of Wilfred Bion. The Journal \u201cSocio-Analysis\u201d is now published by Group Relations Australia.[6]\n\nOrganisational dreaming\nCurrent developments in socio-analysis include Bain\u2019s discovery of Organisational Dreaming,[21]\nwhich is based on the observation that dreams are \u201ccontainer sensitive\u201d, and that the dreams shared by people within an organisation during a project will reflect organisational realities that are the \u201cunexpressed known\u201d within the organisation.[22]\n\nAuthority, wonder and the sangha\nThe work of the Centre for Socio-Analysis has also led to a formulation of \u201cauthority\u201d that is based in wonder and the sangha (Buddhist notion of \u201cpeople on the path\u201d) in contrast to usual understandings that are based on the individual, anxiety, and hierarchy.[3]\n",
