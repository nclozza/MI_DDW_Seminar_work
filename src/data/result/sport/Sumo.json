It is considered a gendai bud\u014d, which refers to modern Japanese martial art, but the sport has a history spanning many centuries. Many ancient traditions have been preserved in sumo, and even today the sport includes many ritual elements, such as the use of salt purification, from Shinto.\nLife as a wrestler is highly regimented, with rules regulated by the Japan Sumo Association. Most sumo wrestlers are required to live in communal sumo training stables, known in Japanese as heya, where all aspects of their daily lives\u2014from meals to their manner of dress\u2014are dictated by strict tradition.\nFrom 2008 to 2016, a number of high-profile controversies and scandals rocked the sumo world, with an associated effect on its reputation and ticket sales. These have also affected the sport's ability to attract recruits.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"title\": \"Decline in apprentices threatens future of national sport\", \"url\": \"http://ajw.asahi.com/article/sports/sumo/AJ201209070047\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20130628045756/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/sports/sumo/AJ201209070047\", \"archivedate\": \"June 28, 2013\", \"accessdate\": \"June 23, 2013\", \"newspaper\": \"Asahi Shimbun\"} Despite this setback, sumo's popularity and general attendance has rebounded due to having multiple yokozuna (or grand champions) for the first time in a number of years and other high-profile wrestlers such as End\u014d and Ichinoj\u014d grabbing the public's attention.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.saga-s.co.jp/column/ariakesyou/124367\", \"title\": \"Revival of sumo's popularity\", \"publisher\": \"Saga Shinbun\", \"language\": \"Japanese\"}\n\nAntiquity (pre-1185)\nPrehistoric wall paintings indicate that sumo originated from an agricultural ritual dance performed in prayer for a good harvest.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.usadojo.com/history-of-sumo/\", \"title\": \"History of Sumo\", \"last\": \"Sharnoff\", \"first\": \"Lora\", \"date\": \"August 13, 2013\", \"website\": \"USA Dojo\"} The first mention of sumo can be found in a Kojiki manuscript dating back to 712, which describes how possession of the Japanese islands was decided in a wrestling match between the kami Takemikazuchi and Takeminakata. Takemikazuchi was the ruler of the common people and Takeminakata was the god of wind, water and agriculture. Takeminakata challenged Takemikazuchi for his land. Takemikazuchi had a grip on Takeminakata's arm and crushed it \"like a reed,\" defeating Takeminakata and claiming his land for his gods.[4]\nThe Nihon Shoki, published in 720, dates the first sumo match between mortals to the year 23 BC, when a man named Nomi no Sukune fought against Taima no Kuehaya at the request of Emperor Suinin and eventually killed him, making him the mythological ancestor of sumo.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.usadojo.com/history-of-sumo/\", \"title\": \"History of Sumo\", \"last\": \"Sharnoff\", \"first\": \"Lora\", \"date\": \"August 13, 2013\", \"website\": \"USA Dojo\"}{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://k-amc.kokugakuin.ac.jp/DM/detail.do?class_name=col_eos&data_id=23231\", \"title\": \"Encyclopedia of Shinto: Sum\\u014d\", \"publisher\": \"Kokugakuin University\", \"author\": \"Shigeru Takayama\"} According to The Nihon Shoki, Nomi broke a rib of Taima with one kick, and killed him with a kick to the back as well.[6]Until the Japanese Middle Ages, this unregulated form of wrestling was often fought to the death of one of the fighters.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.usadojo.com/history-of-sumo/\", \"title\": \"History of Sumo\", \"last\": \"Sharnoff\", \"first\": \"Lora\", \"date\": \"August 13, 2013\", \"website\": \"USA Dojo\"} The first historically-attested sumo fights were held in 642 at the court of Empress K\u014dgyoku to entertain a Korean legation. In the centuries that followed, the popularity of sumo within the court increased its ceremonial and religious significance. Regular events at the Emperor's court, the sumai no sechie, and the establishment of the first set of rules for sumo fall into the cultural heyday of the Heian period.\n\nJapanese Middle Ages (1185\u20131603)\nWith the collapse of the Emperor's central authority, sumo lost its importance in the court; during the Kamakura period, sumo was repurposed from a ceremonial struggle to a form of military combat training among samurai.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.usadojo.com/history-of-sumo/\", \"title\": \"History of Sumo\", \"last\": \"Sharnoff\", \"first\": \"Lora\", \"date\": \"August 13, 2013\", \"website\": \"USA Dojo\"}{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://k-amc.kokugakuin.ac.jp/DM/detail.do?class_name=col_eos&data_id=23231\", \"title\": \"Encyclopedia of Shinto: Sum\\u014d\", \"publisher\": \"Kokugakuin University\", \"author\": \"Shigeru Takayama\"} By the Muromachi period, sumo had fully left the seclusion of the court and became a popular event for the masses, and among the daimy\u014d it became common to sponsor wrestlers. Sumotori who successfully fought for a daimy\u014d's favor were given generous support and samurai status. Oda Nobunaga, a particularly avid fan of the sport, held a tournament of 1,500 wrestlers in February 1578. Because several bouts were to be held simultaneously within Nobunaga's castle, circular arenas were delimited to hasten the proceedings and to maintain the safety of the spectators. This event marks the invention of the dohy\u014d, which would be developed into its current form up until the 18th century.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.usadojo.com/history-of-sumo/\", \"title\": \"History of Sumo\", \"last\": \"Sharnoff\", \"first\": \"Lora\", \"date\": \"August 13, 2013\", \"website\": \"USA Dojo\"} The winner of Nobunaga's tournament was given a bow for being victorious and he began dancing to show the war-lord his gratitude.[7]\n\nEdo period (1603\u20131867)\nBecause sumo had become a nuisance due to wild fighting on the streets, particularly in Edo, sumo was temporarily banned in the city during the Edo period. In 1684, sumo was permitted to be held for charity events on the property of Shinto shrines, as was common in Kyoto and Osaka. The first sanctioned tournament took place in the Tomioka Hachiman Shrine at this time. An official sumo organization was developed, consisting of professional wrestlers at the disposal of the Edo administration. Many elements date from this period, such as the dohy\u014d-iri, the heya system, the gy\u014dji and the mawashi. The 18th century brought forth several notable wrestlers such as Raiden Tameemon, Onogawa Kisabur\u014d and Tanikaze Kajinosuke, the first historical yokozuna.\n\nSince 1868\nThe Meiji Restoration of 1868 brought about the end of the feudal system, and with it the wealthy daimy\u014d as sponsors. Due to a new fixation on Western culture, sumo had come to be seen as an embarrassing and backward relic, and internal disputes split the central association. The popularity of sumo was restored when Emperor Meiji organized a tournament in 1884; his example would make sumo a national symbol and contribute to nationalist sentiment following military successes against Korea and China. The Japan Sumo Association reunited in 1926 and increased the number of annual tournaments from two to four, and then to six in 1958. The length of tournaments was extended from ten to fifteen days in 1949.[8]\nSumo was a regulated sport, but the yokozuna rank wasn't recognized as a rank until 1909. The Japan Sumo Association was formed on December 28th, 1925.[9]\n\nWinning a sumo bout\nThe winner of a sumo bout is generally either the first wrestler to force his opponent to step out of the ring, or the first wrestler to force his opponent to touch the ground with any part of his body other than the bottom of his feet. Also, a number of other less common rules can be used to determine the winner. For example, a wrestler using an illegal technique (kinjite) automatically loses, as does one whose mawashi (belt) comes completely undone. A wrestler failing to show up for his bout (even if due to prior injury) also automatically loses (fusenpai).\nThe initial crouch and charge are crucial. Upon positioning themselves opposite each other, the wrestlers perform a deep squat; without taking their feet off the ground, they then move forwards into a head-first crouched position, whilst also resting on one or two fists. This position is important because it allows them to adopt a more efficient posture to charge from and also isometrically preloads their muscles: this enables them to spring up and charge their opponents more powerfully when the referee signals the bout to begin.  A successful charge is usually a powerful charge and is often a key determining factor in who wins the bout.\nBouts consist solely of a single round and often last only a few seconds, as usually one wrestler is quickly ousted from the circle or thrown to the ground. However, they can occasionally last for several minutes. Each match is preceded by an elaborate ceremonial ritual. Traditionally, sumo wrestlers are renowned for their great girth and body mass, which is often a winning factor in sumo. No weight divisions are used in professional sumo; a wrestler can sometimes face an opponent twice his own weight. However, with superior technique, smaller wrestlers can control and defeat much larger opponents.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://sumo.goo.ne.jp/eng/ozumo_joho_kyoku/shiru/kiso_chishiki/beginners_guide/rules.html\", \"title\": \"Rules of Sumo\", \"publisher\": \"[[Japan Sumo Association]]\", \"accessdate\": \"June 26, 2007\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20070601161839/http://sumo.goo.ne.jp/eng/ozumo_joho_kyoku/shiru/kiso_chishiki/beginners_guide/rules.html\", \"archivedate\": \"June 1, 2007\", \"work\": \"Beginner's Guide of Sumo\"} The average weight of top division wrestlers has continued to increase, from 125 kilograms (276\u00a0lb) in 1969 to over 150 kilograms (330\u00a0lb) by 1991, and was a record 166 kilograms (366\u00a0lb) as of January 2019.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"19 February 2019\", \"title\": \"SUMO/ Heavier wrestlers blamed for increase in serious injuries\", \"url\": \"http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/AJ201902190008.html\", \"newspaper\": \"Asahi Shimbun\"}\nIn some situations, a review of the gy\u014dji's decision may be needed.  The judges outside the ring, who sit at eye level (the shimpan) may convene a conference in the middle of the ring, called a mono-ii.  This is done if the judges decide that the decision over who won the bout needs to be reviewed; for example, if both sumotori appear to touch the ground or step out of the ring at the same time.  In these cases, sometimes video is reviewed to see what happened.  Once a decision is made, the chief judge will announce the decision to the spectators and the wrestlers alike.  They may order a bout to be restarted, or leave the decision as given by the gy\u014dji. Occasionally the shimpan will overrule the gy\u014dji and give the bout to the other wrestler.\nAfter the winner is declared, an off-stage gy\u014dji (referee) determines the kimarite (or winning technique) used in the bout, which is then announced to the audience. The Japan Sumo Association recognizes 82 different kimarite and 5 different hiwaza (or non-technique) in a win.  \nOn rare occasions the referee or judges may award the win to the wrestler who touched the ground first. This happens if both wrestlers touch the ground at nearly the same time and it is decided that the wrestler who touched the ground second had no chance of winning, his opponent's superior sumo having put him in an irrecoverable position. The losing wrestler is referred to as being shini-tai (\"dead body\") in this case.\n\nWrestling ring (dohy\u014d)\nSumo matches take place in a dohy\u014d[12] (\u571f\u4ff5): a ring, 4.55\u00a0m (14.9\u00a0ft) in diameter and 16.26\u00a0m2 (175.0\u00a0sq\u00a0ft) in area, of rice-straw bales on top of a platform made of clay mixed with sand. A new dohy\u014d is built for each tournament by the bout callers (or yobidashi). At the center are two white lines, the shikiri-sen, behind which the wrestlers position themselves at the start of the bout.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"1997\", \"title\": \"The Big Book of Sumo: History, Practice, Ritual, Fight\", \"publisher\": \"Stone Bridge Press\", \"isbn\": \"1-880656-28-0\", \"last\": \"Hall\", \"first\": \"Mina\", \"urlaccess\": \"registration\"} A roof resembling that of a Shinto shrine may be suspended over the dohy\u014d. Women are traditionally forbidden from entering or touching the ring.[14]\n\nProfessional sumo\nProfessional sumo is organized by the Japan Sumo Association.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"1993\", \"title\": \"Grand Sumo\", \"publisher\": \"Weatherhill\", \"author\": \"Sharnoff, Lora\"} The members of the association, called oyakata, are all former wrestlers, and are the only people entitled to train new wrestlers. Most practicing wrestlers are members of a training stable  (or heya) run by one of the oyakata, who is the stablemaster for the wrestlers under him. In 2007, 43 training stables hosted 660 wrestlers.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://sumo.goo.ne.jp/eng/ozumo_meikan/sumo_beya/index.html\", \"title\": \"Sumo Beya Guide\", \"publisher\": \"[[Japan Sumo Association]]\", \"accessdate\": \"July 8, 2007\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20070715230032/http://sumo.goo.ne.jp/eng/ozumo_meikan/sumo_beya/index.html\", \"archivedate\": \"July 15, 2007\"}\nAll sumo wrestlers take wrestling names called shikona (\u56db\u80a1\u540d), which may or may not be related to their real names. Often, wrestlers have little choice in their names, which are given to them by their trainers (or stablemasters), or by a supporter or family member who encouraged them into the sport. This is particularly true of foreign-born wrestlers. A wrestler may change his wrestling name during his career, with some wrestlers changing theirs several times.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"1993\", \"title\": \"Grand Sumo\", \"publisher\": \"Weatherhill\", \"author\": \"Sharnoff, Lora\"}\nSumo wrestling is a strict hierarchy based on sporting merit. The wrestlers are ranked according to a system that dates back to the Edo period. Wrestlers are promoted or demoted according to their performance in six official tournaments held throughout the year. A carefully prepared banzuke listing the full hierarchy is published two weeks prior to each sumo tournament.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"February 19, 2010\", \"title\": \"Steeped in tradition, Shinto, sumo is also scandal-stained\", \"url\": \"http://www.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20100216i1.html\", \"author\": \"Kamiya, Setsuko\", \"newspaper\": \"[[Japan Times]]\"}\nIn addition to the professional tournaments, exhibition competitions are held at regular intervals every year in Japan, and roughly once every two years, the top-ranked wrestlers visit a foreign country for such exhibitions. None of these displays is taken into account in determining a wrestler's future rank. Rank is determined only by performance in grand sumo tournaments (or honbasho).{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"1997\", \"title\": \"The Big Book of Sumo: History, Practice, Ritual, Fight\", \"publisher\": \"Stone Bridge Press\", \"isbn\": \"1-880656-28-0\", \"last\": \"Hall\", \"first\": \"Mina\", \"urlaccess\": \"registration\"}\n\nSumo divisions\nThe six divisions in sumo, in descending order of prestige, are:\nWrestlers enter sumo in the lowest jonokuchi division and, ability permitting, work their way up to the top division. A broad demarcation in the sumo world can be seen between the wrestlers in the top two divisions known as sekitori (\u95a2\u53d6) and those in the four lower divisions, known commonly by the more generic term rikishi (\u529b\u58eb).  The ranks receive different levels of compensation, privileges, and status.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://sumo.goo.ne.jp/eng/ozumo_joho_kyoku/shiru/kiso_chishiki/beginners_guide/banzuke.html\", \"title\": \"Banzuke\", \"publisher\": \"[[Japan Sumo Association]]\", \"accessdate\": \"June 27, 2007\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20070630033048/http://sumo.goo.ne.jp/eng/ozumo_joho_kyoku/shiru/kiso_chishiki/beginners_guide/banzuke.html\", \"archivedate\": \"June 30, 2007\", \"work\": \"Beginner's Guide of Sumo\"}\nThe topmost makuuchi division receives the most attention from fans and has the most complex hierarchy. The majority of wrestlers are maegashira (\u524d\u982d) and are ranked from the highest level 1 down to about 16 or 17. In each rank are two wrestlers, the higher rank is designated as \"east\" and the lower as \"west\", so the list goes #1 east, #1 west, #2 east, #2 west, etc.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.scgroup.com/sumo/faq/faq4.html\", \"title\": \"Sumo FAQ - Professional rankings: The Banzuke\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20121001032019/http://www.scgroup.com/sumo/faq/faq4.html\", \"archivedate\": \"October 1, 2012\", \"work\": \"scgroup.com\"} Above the maegashira are the three champion or titleholder ranks, called the san'yaku, which are not numbered. These are, in ascending order, komusubi (\u5c0f\u7d50), sekiwake (\u95a2\u8107), and \u014dzeki (\u5927\u95a2). At the pinnacle of the ranking system is the rank of yokozuna (\u6a2a\u7db1).{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://sumo.goo.ne.jp/eng/ozumo_joho_kyoku/shiru/kiso_chishiki/beginners_guide/banzuke.html\", \"title\": \"Banzuke\", \"publisher\": \"[[Japan Sumo Association]]\", \"accessdate\": \"June 27, 2007\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20070630033048/http://sumo.goo.ne.jp/eng/ozumo_joho_kyoku/shiru/kiso_chishiki/beginners_guide/banzuke.html\", \"archivedate\": \"June 30, 2007\", \"work\": \"Beginner's Guide of Sumo\"}\nYokozuna, or grand champions, are generally expected to compete for and to win the top division tournament title on a regular basis, hence the promotion criteria for yokozuna are very strict. In general, an \u014dzeki must win the championship for two consecutive tournaments or an \"equivalent performance\" to be considered for promotion to yokozuna.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"1993\", \"title\": \"Grand Sumo\", \"publisher\": \"Weatherhill\", \"author\": \"Sharnoff, Lora\"} More than one wrestler can hold the rank of yokozuna at the same time.\nIn antiquity, sumo was solely a Japanese sport. Since the 1900s, however, the number of foreign-born sumo wrestlers has gradually increased.  In the beginning of this period, these few foreign wrestlers were listed as Japanese, but particularly since the 1960s, a number of high-profile foreign-born wrestlers became well-known, and in more recent years have even come to dominate in the highest ranks.  Half of the last six wrestlers promoted to \u014dzeki have been foreign-born, and a Japanese had not been named yokozuna from 1998 until the promotion of Kisenosato Yutaka in 2017.  This and other issues eventually led the Sumo Association to limit the number of foreigners allowed to one in each stable.\n\nWomen and sumo\nWomen are not allowed to compete in professional sumo. They are also not allowed to enter the wrestling ring (dohy\u014d), a tradition stemming from Shinto and Buddhist beliefs that women are \"impure\" because of menstrual blood.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"last1\": \"Yoshida\", \"first1\": \"Reiji\", \"title\": \"Banning women from the sumo ring: centuries-old tradition, straight-up sexism or something more complex?\", \"url\": \"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2018/04/30/national/social-issues/banning-women-sumo-ring-sexism-centuries-old-cultural-tradition/\", \"work\": \"The Japan Times\", \"accessdate\": \"11 December 2019\"}[21]\n\nProfessional sumo tournaments\nSince 1958, six Grand Sumo tournaments (Japanese: honbasho) have been held each year: three at the Sumo Hall (or Ry\u014dgoku Kokugikan) in Ry\u014dgoku, Tokyo (January, May, and September), and one each in Osaka (March), Nagoya (July), and Fukuoka (November). Each tournament begins on a Sunday and runs for 15 days, ending also on a Sunday.[22] The tournaments are organized in a manner akin to a McMahon system tournament; each wrestler in the top two divisions (sekitori) has one match per day, while the lower-ranked wrestlers compete in seven bouts, about one every two days.\nEach day is structured so that the highest-ranked contestants compete at the end of the day. Thus, wrestling starts in the morning with the jonokuchi wrestlers and ends at around six o'clock in the evening with bouts involving the yokozuna. The wrestler who wins the most matches over the 15 days wins the tournament championship (y\u016bsh\u014d) for his division. If two wrestlers are tied for the top, they wrestle each other and the winner takes the title. Three-way ties for a championship are rare, at least in the top division. In these cases, the three wrestle each other in pairs with the first to win two in a row take the tournament. More complex systems for championship playoffs involving four or more wrestlers also exist, but these are usually only seen in determining the winner of one of the lower divisions.\nThe matchups for each day of the tournament are announced a day in advance. They are determined by the sumo elders who are members of the judging division of the Sumo Association. As many more wrestlers are in each division than matchups during the tournament, each wrestler only competes against a selection of opponents from the same division, though small overlaps can occur between two divisions. With the exception of the san'yaku-ranked wrestlers, the first bouts tend to be between wrestlers who are within a few ranks of each other. Afterwards, the selection of opponents takes into account a wrestler's prior performance. For example, in the lower divisions, wrestlers with the same record in a tournament are generally matched up with each other and the last matchups often involve undefeated wrestlers competing against each other, even if they are from opposite ends of the division. In the top division, in the last few days, wrestlers with exceptional records often have matches against much more highly ranked opponents, including san'yaku wrestlers, especially if they are still in the running for the top division championship. Similarly, more highly ranked wrestlers with very poor records may find themselves fighting wrestlers much further down the division. For the yokozuna and \u014dzeki, the first week and a half of the tournament tends to be taken up with bouts against the top maegashira, komusubi, and sekiwake, with the bouts within these ranks being concentrated into the last five days or so of the tournament (depending on the number of top-ranked wrestlers competing). Traditionally, on the final day, the last three bouts of the tournament are between the top six ranked wrestlers, with the top two competing in the final matchup, unless injuries during the tournament prevent this.\nCertain match-ups are prohibited in regular tournament play. Wrestlers who are from the same training stable cannot compete against each other, nor can wrestlers who are brothers, even if they join different stables. The one exception to this rule is that training stable partners and brothers can face each other in a championship-deciding playoff match.\nThe last day of the tournament is called sensh\u016braku, which literally means \"the pleasure of a thousand autumns\". This colorful name for the culmination of the tournament echoes the words of the playwright Zeami to represent the excitement of the decisive bouts and the celebration of the victor. The Emperor's Cup is presented to the wrestler who wins the top-division makuuchi championship. Numerous other (mostly sponsored) prizes are also awarded to him. These prizes are often rather elaborate, ornate gifts, such as giant cups, decorative plates, and statuettes. Others are quite commercial, such as one trophy shaped like a giant Coca-Cola bottle.\nPromotion and relegation for the next tournament are determined by a wrestler's score over the 15 days. In the top division, the term kachikoshi means a score of 8\u20137 or better, as opposed to makekoshi, which indicates a score of 7\u20138 or worse. A wrestler who achieves kachikoshi almost always is promoted further up the ladder, the level of promotion being higher for better scores. See the makuuchi article for more details on promotion and relegation.\nA top-division wrestler who is not an \u014dzeki or yokozuna and who finishes the tournament with kachikoshi is also eligible to be considered for one of the three prizes awarded for \"technique\", \"fighting spirit\", and defeating the most yokozuna and \u014dzeki the \"outstanding performance\" prize.  For more information see sansh\u014d.\nFor the list of upper divisions champions since 1909, refer to the list of top division champions and the list of second division champions.\n\nA professional sumo bout\nAt the initial charge, both wrestlers must jump up from the crouch simultaneously after touching the surface of the ring with two fists at the start of the bout. The referee (gy\u014dji) can restart the bout if this simultaneous touch does not occur. Upon completion of the bout, the referee must immediately designate his decision by pointing his gunbai or war-fan towards the winning side. The winning technique (kimarite) used by the winner would then be announced to the audience. The referee's decision is not final and may be disputed by the five judges seated around the ring. If this happens, they meet in the center of the ring to hold a mono-ii (a talk about things). After reaching a consensus, they can uphold or reverse the referee's decision or order a rematch, known as a torinaoshi. The wrestlers then return to their starting positions and bow to each other before retiring. A winning wrestler in the top division may receive additional prize money in envelopes from the referee if the matchup has been sponsored. If a yokozuna is defeated by a lower-ranked wrestler, it is common and expected for audience members to throw their seat cushions into the ring (and onto the wrestlers), though this practice is technically prohibited.\nIn contrast to the time in bout preparation, bouts are typically very short, usually less than a minute (most of the time only a few seconds). Extremely rarely, a bout can go on for several minutes. If a bout lasts up to four minutes, the referee or one of the judges sitting around the ring may call a mizu-iri or \"water break\". The wrestlers are carefully separated, have a brief break, and then return to the exact position they left, as determined by the referee. If after four more minutes, they are still deadlocked, they may have a second break, after which they start from the beginning. Further deadlock with no end of the bout in sight can lead to a draw (hikiwake), an extremely rare result in modern sumo. The last draw in the top division was in September 1974.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"1993\", \"title\": \"Grand Sumo\", \"publisher\": \"Weatherhill\", \"author\": \"Sharnoff, Lora\"}\n\nLife as a professional sumo wrestler\nA sumo wrestler leads a highly regimented way of life. The Sumo Association prescribes the behavior of its wrestlers in some detail. For example, the association prohibits wrestlers from driving cars, although this is partly out of necessity as many wrestlers are too big to fit behind a steering wheel.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"2017-12-01\", \"title\": \"Inside the scandal-hit world of sumo\", \"url\": \"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-42178483\", \"work\": \"BBC News\", \"last\": \"Seales\", \"first\": \"Rebecca\"} Breaking the rules can result in fines and/or suspension for both the offending wrestler and his stablemaster.\nOn entering sumo, they are expected to grow their hair long to form a topknot, or chonmage, similar to the samurai hairstyles of the Edo period. Furthermore, they are expected to wear the chonmage and traditional Japanese dress when in public, allowing them to be identified immediately as wrestlers.\nThe type and quality of the dress depends on the wrestler's rank. Rikishi in jonidan and below are allowed to wear only a thin cotton robe called a yukata, even in winter. Furthermore, when outside, they must wear a form of wooden sandal called geta. Wrestlers in the makushita and sandanme divisions can wear a form of traditional short overcoat over their yukata and are allowed to wear straw sandals, called z\u014dri. The higher-ranked sekitori can wear silk robes of their own choice, and the quality of the garb is significantly improved. They also are expected to wear a more elaborate form of topknot called an \u014dich\u014d (big ginkgo leaf) on formal occasions.\nSimilar distinctions are made in stable life. The junior wrestlers must get up earliest, around 5\u00a0am, for training, whereas the sekitori may start around 7\u00a0am. When the sekitori are training, the junior wrestlers may have chores to do, such as assisting in cooking the lunch, cleaning, and preparing the bath,  holding a sekitori's towel, or wiping the sweat from him. The ranking hierarchy is preserved for the order of precedence in bathing after training, and in eating lunch.\nWrestlers are not normally allowed to eat breakfast and are expected to have a siesta-like nap after a large lunch. The most common type of lunch served is the traditional sumo meal of chankonabe, which consists of a simmering stew of various fish, meat, and vegetables cooked at the table. It is usually eaten with rice and washed down with beer. This regimen of no breakfast and a large lunch followed by a sleep is intended to help wrestlers put on a lot of weight so as to compete more effectively.\nIn the afternoon, the junior wrestlers again usually have cleaning or other chores, while their sekitori counterparts may relax, or deal with work issues related to their fan clubs. Younger wrestlers also attend classes, although their education differs from the typical curriculum of their non-sumo peers. In the evening, sekitori may go out with their sponsors, while the junior wrestlers generally stay at home in the stable, unless they are to accompany the stablemaster or a sekitori as his tsukebito (manservant) when he is out. Becoming a tsukebito for a senior member of the stable is a typical duty. A sekitori has a number of tsukebito, depending on the size of the stable or in some cases depending on the size of the sekitori.  The junior wrestlers are given the most mundane tasks such as cleaning the stable, running errands, and even washing or massaging the exceptionally large sekitori while only the senior tsukebito accompany the sekitori when he goes out.\nThe sekitori are given their own room in the stable, or may live in their own apartments, as do married wrestlers; the junior wrestlers sleep in communal dormitories. Thus, the world of the sumo wrestler is split broadly between the junior wrestlers, who serve, and the sekitori, who are served. Life is especially harsh for recruits, to whom the worst jobs tend to be allocated, and the dropout rate at this stage is high.\nThe negative health effects of the sumo lifestyle can become apparent later in life. Sumo wrestlers have a life expectancy between 60 and 65, more than 10 years shorter than the average Japanese male, as the diet and sport take a toll on the wrestler's body. Many develop type 2 diabetes or high blood pressure, and they are prone to heart attacks due to the enormous amount of body mass and fat that they accumulate. The excessive intake of alcohol can lead to liver problems and the stress on their joints due to their excess weight can cause arthritis. Recently, the standards of weight gain are becoming less strict, in an effort to improve the overall health of the wrestlers.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.discoverychannelasia.com/sumo/become_a_sumo_wrestler/index.shtml\", \"title\": \"Becoming a Sumo Wrestler\", \"publisher\": \"[[Discovery Channel]]\", \"accessdate\": \"November 18, 2005\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20050831220303/http://discoverychannelasia.com/sumo/become_a_sumo_wrestler/index.shtml\", \"archivedate\": \"August 31, 2005\", \"work\": \"Sumo East and West\"}{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/products/dyb/dyb2.htm\", \"title\": \"United Nations Statistics Division \\u2013 Demographic and Social Statistics\"}\n\nMinimum height requirement\nSome sumo organizations have minimum height requirements for their competitors. In 1994, the Japanese Sumo Association required that all sumo wrestlers be a minimum 173\u00a0cm (5 feet 8 inches) in height. This prompted 16-year-old Takeji Harada of Japan (who had failed six previous eligibility tests) to have four separate cosmetic surgeries over a period of 12 months to add an extra 15\u00a0cm (6 inches) of silicone to his scalp, which created a large, protruding bulge on his head.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"year\": \"1994\", \"title\": \"Wrestlers Go Great Lengths To Qualify\", \"url\": \"http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19940707&slug=1919134\", \"last\": \"Ashmun\", \"first\": \"Chuck\", \"newspaper\": \"Seattle Times\"} In response to this, the Japanese Sumo Association stated that they would no longer accept aspiring wrestlers who surgically enhanced their height, citing health concerns.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://articles.latimes.com/1994-07-07/news/mn-13018_1_minimum-height\", \"title\": \"Silicone Raises Sumo Hopeful to New Heights\", \"date\": \"July 7, 1994\"}\n\nSalary and payment\nAs of 2018[update], the monthly salary figures for makuuchi (in Japanese yen) were:{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.sankei.com/sports/news/181129/spo1811290026-n1.html\", \"title\": \"Rikishi Salaries\", \"language\": \"Japanese\"}\nWrestlers lower than the second division, who are considered trainees, receive only a fairly small allowance instead of a salary.\nIn addition to the basic salary, sekitori wrestlers also receive additional bonus income, called mochiky\u016bkin, six times a year (once every tournament, or basho) based on the cumulative performance in their career to date. This bonus increases every time the wrestler scores a kachikoshi (with larger kachikoshi giving larger raises). Special increases in this bonus are also awarded for winning the top division championship (with an extra large increase for a \"perfect\" championship victory with no losses), and also for scoring a gold star or kinboshi (an upset of a yokozuna by a maegashira).\nSan'yaku wrestlers also receive a relatively small additional tournament allowance, depending on their rank, and yokozuna receive an additional allowance every second tournament, associated with the making of a new tsuna belt worn in their ring entering ceremony.\nAlso, prize money is given to the winner of each divisional championship, which increases from 100,000 yen for a jonokuchi victory up to 10,000,000 yen for winning the top division. In addition to prizes for a championship, wrestlers in the top division giving an exceptional performance in the eyes of a judging panel can also receive one or more of three special prizes (the sansh\u014d), which are worth 2,000,000 yen each.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.sumotalk.com/sumofaq.htm\", \"title\": \"Sumo Questions\"}\nIndividual top division matches can also be sponsored by companies. In such cases, the winner of the bout typically receives around 30,000 yen net per sponsor (out of the sponsors' contribution of 60,000 yen\u2014much of the remainder goes in paying the wrestler's tax on the prize). These bout prizes are called kensh\u014dkin. For bouts involving yokozuna and \u014dzeki, the number of sponsors of the matchup can be quite large, whereas for lower-ranked matchups, no bout sponsors may be active at all unless one of the wrestlers is particularly popular, or unless a company has a policy of sponsoring all his matchups. No bout prize money is awarded for a bout decided by a fusensh\u014d or forfeit victory.\n\nAmateur sumo\nSumo is also practised as an amateur sport, with participants in college, high school, and grade school in Japan. In addition to college and school tournaments, open amateur tournaments are also held. The sport at this level is stripped of most of the ceremony. The most successful amateur wrestlers in Japan (usually college champions) can be allowed to enter professional sumo at makushita (third division) rather than from the very bottom of the ladder. This rank is called makushita tsukedashi, and is currently makushita 10 or 15 depending on the level of amateur success achieved. Many of the current top division wrestlers entered professional sumo by this route. All amateur athletes entering the professional ranks must be under 23 to satisfy the entry, except those who qualify for makushita tsukedashi, who may be up to 25.\nThe International Sumo Federation was established to encourage the sport's development worldwide, including holding international championships. A key aim of the federation is to have sumo recognized as an Olympic sport. Accordingly, amateur tournaments are divided into weight classes (men: Lightweight up to 85\u00a0kg (187\u00a0lb), Middleweight up to 115\u00a0kg (254\u00a0lb), Heavyweight over 115\u00a0kg (254\u00a0lb), and Open Weight (unrestricted entry), and include competitions for female wrestlers (Lightweight up to 65\u00a0kg (143\u00a0lb), Middleweight up to 80\u00a0kg (180\u00a0lb), Heavyweight over 80\u00a0kg (180\u00a0lb), and Open Weight).\nAmateur sumo clubs are gaining in popularity in the United States, with competitions regularly being held in major cities across the country. The US Sumo Open, for example, was held in the Los Angeles Convention Center in 2007 with an audience of 3,000.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"publisher\": \"Amazon\", \"last \": \"Gould\", \"first \": \"Chris\", \"year \": \"2011\", \"title \": \"Sumo Through the Wrestlers' Eyes\"} The sport has long been popular on the West Coast and in Hawaii, where it has played a part in the festivals of the Japanese ethnic communities. Now, however, the sport has grown beyond the sphere of Japanese diaspora and athletes come from a variety of ethnic, cultural, and sporting backgrounds.\nAmateur sumo is particularly strong in Europe. Many athletes come to the sport from a background in judo, freestyle wrestling, or other grappling sports such as sambo. Some Eastern European athletes have been successful enough to be scouted into professional sumo in Japan, much like their Japanese amateur counterparts. The most notable of these to date is the Bulgarian Koto\u014dsh\u016b, who is the highest-ranking foreign wrestler who was formerly an amateur sumo athlete.\nBrazil is another center of amateur sumo, introduced by Japanese immigrants who arrived during the first half of the twentieth century. The first Brazilian sumo tournament was held in 1914.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"January 27, 2005\", \"title\": \"Brazil's Japanese Preserve Sumo and Share It With Others\", \"url\": \"https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/27/world/americas/brazils-japanese-preserve-sumo-and-share-it-with-others.html?_r=0\", \"work\": \"The New York Times\", \"accessdate\": \"November 21, 2016\", \"last\": \"Benson\", \"first\": \"Todd\"}  Sumo took root in immigrant centers in southern Brazil, especially S\u00e3o Paulo, which is now home to the only purpose-built sumo training facility outside Japan.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"August 2, 2016\", \"title\": \"'Sumo feminino': How Brazil's female sumo wrestlers are knocking down gender barriers\", \"url\": \"http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/brazil-female-sumo-wrestlers-1.3703178\", \"work\": \"CBC News\", \"accessdate\": \"November 21, 2016\", \"last\": \"Kwok\", \"first\": \"Matt\"}  Beginning in the 1990s, Brazilian sumo organizations made an effort to interest Brazilians without Japanese ancestry in the sport, and by the mid-2000s an estimated 70% of participants came from outside the Japanese-Brazilian community.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"January 27, 2005\", \"title\": \"Brazil's Japanese Preserve Sumo and Share It With Others\", \"url\": \"https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/27/world/americas/brazils-japanese-preserve-sumo-and-share-it-with-others.html?_r=0\", \"work\": \"The New York Times\", \"accessdate\": \"November 21, 2016\", \"last\": \"Benson\", \"first\": \"Todd\"}  Brazil is also a center for women's sumo.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"August 2, 2016\", \"title\": \"'Sumo feminino': How Brazil's female sumo wrestlers are knocking down gender barriers\", \"url\": \"http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/brazil-female-sumo-wrestlers-1.3703178\", \"work\": \"CBC News\", \"accessdate\": \"November 21, 2016\", \"last\": \"Kwok\", \"first\": \"Matt\"}  A small number of Brazilian wrestlers have made the transition to professional sumo in Japan, including Ry\u016bk\u014d G\u014d and Kaisei Ichir\u014d.\n\nClothing\nSumo wrestlers wear Mawashi which is essentially a thick 30-foot-long belt, that they tie in knots in the back.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.usasumo.com/shop/sumo-equipment/\", \"title\": \"Sumo Equipment\", \"urlstatus\": \"live\"} They have an official thickness and strength requirement.

The different Mawashi that the wrestlers wear differentiate their rank. Top rated wrestlers wear different colors of silk Mawashi during tournament, while lower rated wrestlers are limited to just black cotton. Sumo wrestlers wear Mawashi because there are fewer ways to cheat when you wear one.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.livestrong.com/article/483679-what-do-sumo-wrestlers-wear-during-a-match/\", \"title\": \"What Do Sumo Wrestlers Wear During a Match?\", \"website\": \"LIVESTRONG.COM\", \"language\": \"en\", \"urlstatus\": \"live\"}\nTheir hair is put in what they call a topknot, and they use wax to get it to stay.
