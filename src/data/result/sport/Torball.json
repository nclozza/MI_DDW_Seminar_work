    "content": "Torball\nTorball (German: goal ball) is a sport for the blind and visually impaired. It is played by two teams on opposite sides of an indoor playing field. Each team consists of three players. In the middle part of the field, there are three cords stretched across the entire width. On each end of the playing field is a goal that also stretches the entire width (6\u00a0m (20\u00a0ft)) of the field. The playing ball is similar to a soccer ball with bells inside so that it can be heard when it is rolling across the playing field.\n\nDescription\nThe object of the game is to score as many goals as possible by rolling the ball under the three cords into the goal of the opposing team. The three-player teams are both attackers and defenders during the two five-minute periods. If the ball touches one of the three cords, a penalty is called, where one player leaves the field and the remaining two players must try to defend their goal for one \u2018throw\u2019 by the opposing team.\n\nOfficial IBSA Torball rules\nThe current official rules for Torball can be downloaded from the International Blind Sports Federation website.\n",
