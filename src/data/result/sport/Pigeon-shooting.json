{"url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeon-shooting", "content": "Pigeon-shooting\nPigeon shooting is a type of live bird wing shooting competition. Traditionally, there are two types of competition: box birds and columbaire. In box birds, the pigeons are held in a mechanical device that releases them when the shooter calls out. In columbaire, the birds are hand thrown by a person when called upon. The pigeons are bred for speed. The most common species of pigeon used in regulated shooting contests being known as a zurito (Columba oenas). In the shooting competition, large sums of money are gambled and winners can have purses exceeding US$50,000. The equipment for the sport can be specialized and purpose-built. \nIn the past, the sport was popular worldwide. It was primarily a sport of the upper class and was held at resort locations such as Monaco and Havana. Popular magazines have covered the sport\u2014for example, Field & Stream and Sports Illustrated But, over time, the sport has fallen out of widespread favor due to costs, alternative shooting sports such as trap shooting, skeet shooting, and sporting clays, and of course, animal rights activism over a blood sport. Proponents of the sport argue that live pigeons are more challenging to shoot than clay targets. Many claim that pigeon shoots are no more cruel than extermination efforts carried out in cities where feral pigeons are considered a nuisance and are often controlled using lethal methods.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.phillyvoice.com/pennsylvania-clings-to-pigeon-shoots-that-have-nearly-vanished-nationwide/\", \"title\": \"Pennsylvania clings to pigeon shoots that have nearly vanished nationwide\", \"date\": \"5 June 2017\", \"website\": \"PhillyVoice\"} The United States Department of Agriculture euthanizes over 60,000 pigeons a year in response to complaints.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/15/magazine/15pigeons.html\", \"title\": \"Pigeon Wars\", \"last\": \"Mooallem\", \"first\": \"Jon\", \"date\": \"15 October 2006\", \"accessdate\": \"6 January 2019\"}\nIn the past, events used to be publicly posted.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"title\": \"San Antonio Express from San Antonio, Texas on February 11, 1965 &middot; Page 55\", \"url\": \"https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/85051463/\", \"language\": \"en\", \"newspaper\": \"Newspapers.com\"} The sport still exists in pockets around the world, but generally, it is not well publicized and it is only hosted in select locations, such as private gun clubs typically by invitation only. \nIn the United States live pigeon shoots have been held on large privately owned ranches and plantations in the South.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://broxtonbridge.com/tower.htm\", \"title\": \"Broxton Bridge Plantation Ehrhardt South Carolina Pheasant & Pigeon TowerShoots\", \"website\": \"broxtonbridge.com\"} {\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://kfor.com/2017/08/23/sen-inhofe-to-end-controversial-pigeon-shoot-fundraiser-in-oklahoma/\", \"title\": \"Sen.

The Philadelphia Gun Club overlooking the Delaware River in Bensalem, Pennsylvania, is one of the oldest gun clubs in the United States. Founded in 1877 at the height of the Gilded Age the club opened to a many socially prominent gentlemen and their ladies. In 1895 the club acquired the historic Bickley Mansion for use as a club house.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://libwww.freelibrary.org/digital/item/42853\", \"title\": \"Digital Collections: Club House, Philadelphia Gun Club, Formerly Bickley Mansion.\", \"website\": \"Free Library of Philadelphia\"} The club currently has 61 members.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.all-creatures.org/articles/ar-gun.html\", \"title\": \"Gun Club's Pigeon Shoots Ruffles Feathers\", \"website\": \"www.all-creatures.org\"}\nThe club attracted many wealthy American sportsmen including several members of the Vanderbilt Family. William Kissam Vanderbilt II and Harry Payne Whitney who married Gertrude Vanderbilt in 1896 were both members.  Edward Burd Grubb Jr. a former Union Army General, businessman and New Jersey politician who was appointed as United States Ambassador to Spain by Benjamin Harrison, and was a close associate of Woodrow Wilson was an early president of the club.  In addition to the shooting range the club also had a boathouse on the river, and kennels for hunting dogs. Annie Oakley and her then employer, Buffalo Bill attended shoots at the Philadelphia Gun Club around the turn of the century. \nIn 1928, outdoor writer and conservationist Nash Buckingham, who contributed many articles to Field and Stream, shot his famous A.H. Fox waterfowl gun, \"Bo Whoop\", that had been custom built in Philadelphia by gunsmith Burt Becker at the club, as a guest of the magazine's publisher.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.digitaleditionsonline.com/article/The+Story+Of+Bo-Whoop/499833/47193/article.html\", \"title\": \"The Story Of Bo-Whoop\", \"website\": \"www.digitaleditionsonline.com\"} In the 1930s and 1940s, club members and guests included notables such as writer Ernest Hemingway, who also participated in live pigeon shoots in Europe and Cuba,{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://app.tt.se/bildobjekt/image/sdlta2281bd\", \"title\": \"Hemingway Pigeon Shoot 1942\", \"website\": \"app.tt.se\"}{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.shotgunlife.com/shotguns/guns/the-browning-ernest-hemingway-left-behind-in-paris.html\", \"title\": \"The Browning Ernest Hemingway Left Behind in Paris\", \"last\": \"Sanger\", \"first\": \"Silvio Calabi, Steve Helsley & Roger\", \"website\": \"Shotgun Life\"} and Canadian jazz musician Charles Biddle.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.all-creatures.org/articles/ar-gun.html\", \"title\": \"Gun Club's Pigeon Shoots Ruffles Feathers\", \"website\": \"www.all-creatures.org\"}\nThe controversy surrounding live pigeon shoots at the Philadelphia Gun Club goes back more than a century.

Held annually from 1934 to 1998, this live pigeon shoot, known as the Fred Coleman Memorial shoot, once drew around 10,000 people. It was finally called off in 1999 following years of protests by animal rights activists and a legal battle that ultimately went all the way to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.phillyvoice.com/pennsylvania-clings-to-pigeon-shoots-that-have-nearly-vanished-nationwide/\", \"title\": \"Pennsylvania clings to pigeon shoots that have nearly vanished nationwide\", \"date\": \"5 June 2017\", \"website\": \"PhillyVoice\"}\n\nFirearms and ammunition\nTraditionally, live pigeon shooting guns were heavier than a regular field gun (greater than 7 pounds).
