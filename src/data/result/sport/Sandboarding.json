    "content": "Sandboarding\nSandboarding is a boardsport and extreme sport[citation needed] similar to snowboarding that involves riding across or down a sand dune while standing on a board, either with both feet strapped in or while standing loose, without bindings. Sandboarding can also be practised sitting down or lying on the belly or the back. It typically involves a sandboard, although it is also possible to use sleds, surfboards, a skateboard deck, or snowboards.\nSandboarding has adherents throughout the world, but is most prevalent in desert areas or coastal areas with beach dunes. It is less popular than snowboarding, partly because it is very difficult to build a mechanised ski lift on a sand dune, meaning participants must walk or ride a dune buggy or all-terrain vehicle back to the top of the dune. On the other hand, dunes are normally available year-round as opposed to ski resorts, which are seasonal.\n\nEquipment\nThe sandboard base is much harder than a snowboard, and is built mostly out of formica or laminex with special base materials now being made for this sport by Venomous Sandboards that will slide on wet and dry sand. To glide in the sand, the board bottom is often waxed, usually with a paraffin-based sandboard wax, before a run. Afterwards, the bottom of the board may have a lightly sanded look to it, while 'Venomous Race Base' tends to polish smoother and glossier with use. Most terrain sandboards are composed of hardwood ply, while 'full-size' sandboards are a wood, fiber glass, and plastic composite. However, a snowboarding base will sometimes work on steeper dunes.\n\nSandboarding in Israel\nDrorbamidbar has sandboarding in Israel at Negev Desert not far from Ashalim in the Ramat Negev.\n\nSandboarding in Australia\nLittle Sahara on Kangaroo Island in South Australia is a sand dune system roughly covering two square kilometres (0.77\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). The highest dune is approximately 70 metres (230\u00a0ft) above sea level.\nLucky Bay, about 30 kilometres (19\u00a0mi) south of Kalbarri, in Western Australia, is another sandboarding hotspot. Sandboarding Tours are offered in the area.\nThe Stockton dunes, 2.3 hours north from Sydney. Stockton Bight Sand Dunes system is up to one kilometre (0.62\u00a0mi), 32 kilometres (20\u00a0mi) long, and covers an area of over 4,200 hectares (10,000 acres; 42,000,000\u00a0m2). The massive sand dunes climb up to 40 metres (130\u00a0ft) high. Located only minutes from the centre of Nelson Bay, it is the largest sand dune system in Australia.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.portstephens.org.au/TheSandDunes.aspx\", \"title\": \"Archived copy\", \"accessdate\": \"2011-03-24\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20110216080726/http://www.portstephens.org.au/TheSandDunes.aspx\", \"archivedate\": \"16 February 2011\"}\n\nSandboarding in Africa\nSandboarding sites in Egypt include the Great Sand Sea near Siwa Oasis \u0648\u0627\u062d\u0629 \u0633\u064a\u0648\u0629 in Egypt's Western Desert, the Qattaniya \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0637\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0629 sand dunes (1.5 h drive on/off-road from Cairo), El Safra \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0641\u0631\u0627\u0621 and Hadudah \u0647\u062f\u0648\u062f\u0629 dunes midway between Dahab and St. Catherine in Sinai. \nNamibia features sand-skiing, which is similar to sandboarding, performed with skis instead of a board. Most of the sand-skiing is performed in the Namib desert dunes around Swakopmund and Walvis Bay. With a special permit it is sometimes possible to sand-ski at the world's highest dunes in Sossusvlei.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url \": \"http://www.xtremespots.com/board-sports/sandboarding/swakopmund-erongo-district-namibia/\", \"title \": \"Xtreme Spots\", \"accessdate \": \"26 August 2015\", \"website \": \"Xtreme Spots\"} Henrik May, a German living in Namibia for some 10 years, set a Guinness World Record in speed sand-skiing on 6 June 2010. He reached a speed of 92.12\u00a0km/h (57.24\u00a0mph).[3]\nAfter some pioneers like Derek Bredenkamp who boarded Swakopmund around 1974, commercial operators in South Africa began offering sandboarding to tourists in 1994.[4] In 2000 the Sandboarding South Africa league was established. \nBetween 2002 and 2004 the South African Sandboarding League held competitions on the Matterhorn Dune located between Swakopmund and Walvis bay. Competition events included dual slalom, boarder cross and big air events. In 2005 and 2006 Alter Action held sandboarding competitions at Matterhorn but the competitions no longer formed part of the South African Sandboarding League during those years. The league collapsed, then the sport was revived again in 2007 with weekly sandboarding sessions in and around Cape Town and Gauteng. \n\nSandboarding in the U.S.\nSand Master Park, located in Florence, Oregon USA is the worlds first sandboard park with 200 acres (81\u00a0ha; 810,000\u00a0m2) of pristine sculpted sand dunes and a full-time pro shop. Dune Riders International is the governing body for competitive sandboarding worldwide and sanctions two events each season at Sand Master Park. Sand Master Park is also the factory outlet for the largest sandboard company in the world, Venomous Sandboards.\nGreat Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve near Alamosa, Colorado has sandboarding on what it calls the tallest dunes in North America. [5] Sandboarding and skiing are permitted anywhere on the dunefield away from vegetated areas. [6]\n\nSandboarding in South America\nPeru is known for having large sand dunes in Ica, some reaching up to 2\u00a0km (1.2 miles). Duna Grande in Ica is the largest sand dune in the world. The Copa Sandboarding Per\u00fa (Peru \u2013 Sandboarding Cup) has been held near Paracas every year since 2009.[7] There are also great dunes near the capital city (Lima) in Chilca.\nIn Chile, sandboarding is practiced throughout the north of the country, including the Medanoso dunes in Copiapo (where the Dakar rally takes place), Puerto Viejo beach in Caldera, excellent dunes in Iquique, and some near Vi\u00f1a del Mar.\n\nSandboarding in Central America\nNicaragua is home to Cerro Negro, the youngest volcano in Central America. Since it has steep slopes and volcanic sand, it is possible to sandboard down this active volcano.\n\nSandboarding in Europe\nA rather small sand mountain is the Monte Kaolino in Hirschau, Germany. Being equipped with a lift to the 120-metre (390\u00a0ft) top it is also the host of the annual Sandboarding World Championships. \nAmothines is a small desert five kilometres (3\u00a0mi) from Katalakkos village in Limnos, Greece. There are many sand dunes there, where people can practice sandboarding.\n\nSandboarding in the United Kingdom\nWales is home to the village of Merthyr Mawr that is 2\u00a01\u20442 miles (4\u00a0km) from the town of Bridgend, the village is close to a beach and it is home to the \"Big Dipper\", the second largest sand dune in Europe.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.countryliving.com/uk/wildlife/countryside/news/a2092/merthyr-mawrth-europes-second-largest-sand-dune-big-dipper/\", \"title\": \"A sleepy village in Wales is home to the second largest sand dune in Europe\"}\nHolywell, Cornwall is also home to a beach with a complex of sand dunes; in the summer and during peak times, local shops that cater for beach goers also sell sandboards.\nThe Braunton Burrows sand dunes on the Devon coast, was the filming location for where Alex Bird became the first sandboarder to be towed by a car on British shores.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.menswearstyle.co.uk/2017/02/27/jeep-renegade-desert-hawk-sandboard-stunt/7582\", \"title\": \"JEEP RENEGADE DESERT HAWK SANDBOARDING STUNT\"}\nIn the North East region of the United Kingdom, there is a small beach at Seaton Sluice where people can sandboard. This is a good alternative to sledding, as there is insufficient snow to support sledding there, even though the UK has a rather cold climate, with chilly winters and cool summers.\n\nExternal links\n\n",
