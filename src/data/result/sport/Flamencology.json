It combines research, documentation, and other techniques to achieve the diffusion and preservation of the art.\n\nOrigin of the term\nThe term was coined in 1955 by Spanish Argentine author Anselmo Gonz\u00e1lez Clement in a publication of the same year utilizing the term as its title. The Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola included the term in a revision of the Spanish dictionary through the efforts of the Granadine writer Luis Rosales. The term was diffused as early as 1958 by a group of erudites known as the C\u00e1tedra de Jerez in Jerez de la Frontera, Spain.\n\nInstitutionalization\nThe Discipline is institutionalized throughout the Andaluc\u00eda region in southern Spain. Institutions such as the Universidad de Sevilla (University of Seville) and the Universidad de C\u00f3rdoba (C\u00f3rdoba University) offer specialization in this discipline.\n\nIn Modern Practice\nThe discipline is put into practice through various publications or lectures. Some examples of publications are Revista Alma 100, Revista El Olivo, and Flamenco World.com.\n\nPropagation\nThe extent to which the discipline is practiced varies on the growth of general knowledge of the Flamenco arts. Since the beginning, it has been the purpose of Flamencologists to diffuse the art both locally and abroad, and with the diffusion of the art later come the methods of documenting and researching the art thus putting Flamencology into practice.\nIn practice, people are first exposed to Flamenco as an art be it music or dance. This can be either inherited through family ties or acquired by an aficionado. As in other disciplines, first comes the practice then comes the analysis, methods, techniques, and theory related to an \"ology\".\nThe e has become more formal and taken root outside of Spain, wherever the art is cultivated to the point that documentation can be performed on relevant topics related to respective regions. Countries such as Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica, and Mexico have reached this point with Chilean writers contributing to Flamenco publications in Spain and Chile and in Mexico with the creation of the Instituto Mexicano de Flamencolog\u00eda. In 2005 Argentina, held its first \"Jornada de Flamencolog\u00eda\" with a number of lectures.\n",
