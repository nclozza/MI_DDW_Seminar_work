    "content": "Luge\nA luge /lu\u02d0\u0292/ is a small one- or two-person sled on which one sleds supine (face up) and feet-first. A luger steers by using their calf muscles to flex the sled's runners or by exerting opposite shoulder pressure to the seat. Racing sleds weigh 21\u201325\u00a0kg (46\u201355\u00a0lb) for singles and 25\u201330\u00a0kg (55\u201366\u00a0lb) for doubles.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.teamusa.org/~/media/USA_Luge/Documents/IRO_2014_AT_English.pdf\", \"title\": \"Rules of Artificial Track Luge\"} Luge is also the name of an Olympic sport.\nLugers can reach speeds of 140\u00a0km/h (87\u00a0mph). Austrian Manuel Pfister reached a top speed of 154\u00a0km/h (96\u00a0mph) on a track in Whistler, Canada, prior to the 2010 Winter Olympics.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/sports/2010-02/13/c_13174368.htm\", \"title\": \"Whistler's fast luge track poised risky\", \"date\": \"2010-02-13\", \"publisher\": \"News.xinhuanet.com\", \"accessdate\": \"2011-11-25\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20100216130157/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/sports/2010-02/13/c_13174368.htm\", \"archivedate\": \"2010-02-16\"} Lugers compete against a timer in one of the most precisely timed sports in the world\u2014to one one-thousandth of a second on artificial tracks.\nThe first recorded use of the term \"luge\" dates to 1905 and derives from the Savoy/Swiss dialect of the French word luge, meaning \"small coasting sled.\"{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=luge\", \"title\": \"Online Etymology Dictionary\", \"publisher\": \"Etymonline.com\", \"accessdate\": \"2011-11-25\"}{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.motionvideo.co.nz/kjhkj/extreme-sport-articles/extreme-sports-disicplines/293-lugel.html\", \"title\": \"Luge, extreme sport disciplines\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20160611010017/http://www.motionvideo.co.nz/kjhkj/extreme-sport-articles/extreme-sports-disicplines/293-lugel.html\", \"archivedate\": \"2016-06-11\"}\n\nHistory\nThe  very practical use of sleds is ancient and widespread. The first recorded sled races took place in Norway sometime during the 15th century.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://usaluge.org/aboutluge/history.php/\", \"title\": \"United States Luge Association\", \"publisher\": \"Usaluge.org\", \"accessdate\": \"2011-11-25\"}\nThe sport of luge, like the skeleton and the bobsleigh, originated in the health-spa town of St Moritz, Switzerland, in the mid-to-late 19th century, through the endeavours of hotel entrepreneur Caspar Badrutt. Badrutt successfully sold the idea of winter resorting, as well as rooms with food, drink, and activities. His more adventurous English guests began adapting delivery boys' sleds for recreation, which led to collisions with pedestrians as they sped down the lanes and alleys of the village.\nThe first organized meeting of the sport took place in 1883 in Switzerland.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.fil-luge.org/\", \"title\": \"International Luge Federation\", \"publisher\": \"Fil-luge.org\", \"accessdate\": \"2011-11-25\"} In 1913, the Internationale Schlittensportverband or International Sled Sports Federation was founded in Dresden, Germany. This body governed the sport until 1935, when it was incorporated in the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Bobsleigh et de Tobogganing (FIBT, International Bobsleigh and Tobogganing Federation). After it had been decided that luge would replace the sport of skeleton at the Olympic Games, the first World Championships in the sport were held in 1955 in Oslo (Norway). In 1957, the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Luge de Course (FIL, International Luge Federation) was founded. Luge events were first included in the Olympic Winter Games in 1964.\nAmericans were slow to adopt the sport of luge. The first luge run in North America was built at Lolo Hot Springs, Montana, in 1965.{\"citetype\": \"journal\", \"date\": \"January 2011\", \"journal\": \"Delta Sky Mag\", \"pages\": \"124\"}{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"last \": \"Briggeman\", \"first \": \"Kim\", \"title \": \"Lolo Hot Springs was home to first, 'pretty crude' American luge run\", \"work \": \"[[Missoulian]]\", \"accessdate \": \"2014-02-07\", \"date \": \"2014-02-06\", \"url \": \"http://missoulian.com/news/state-and-regional/lolo-hot-springs-was-home-to-first-pretty-crude-american/article_1f7f3830-8f93-11e3-830f-0019bb2963f4.html\"} Although the United States competed in every Olympic luge event from 1964 through 1976, it was not until 1979 that the United States Luge Association was founded. The first artificial American track was completed in that year for use in the 1980 XIII Winter Olympic Games at Lake Placid, New York.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://usaluge.org/aboutluge/history.php/\", \"title\": \"United States Luge Association\", \"publisher\": \"Usaluge.org\", \"accessdate\": \"2011-11-25\"}\nSince that time the United States luge program has greatly improved. A second artificial track was constructed near Park City, Utah, for the 2002 XIX Olympic Winter Games at Salt Lake City.\nCaitlin Nash and Natalie Corless, both of Canada, became the first all-female team to compete in a Senior World Cup doubles race in luge in 2019.[9]\n\nArtificial tracks\nArtificial luge tracks have specially designed and constructed banked curves plus walled-in straights. Most tracks are artificially refrigerated, but artificial tracks without artificial cooling also exist (for example, in St. Moritz). Tracks tend to be very smooth.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.motionvideo.co.nz/kjhkj/extreme-sport-articles/extreme-sports-disicplines/293-lugel.html\", \"title\": \"Luge, extreme sport disciplines\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20160611010017/http://www.motionvideo.co.nz/kjhkj/extreme-sport-articles/extreme-sports-disicplines/293-lugel.html\", \"archivedate\": \"2016-06-11\"}\nThe athletes ride in a flat, aerodynamic position on the sled, keeping their heads low to minimize air resistance. They steer the sled mainly with their calves by applying pressure on the runners\u2014right calf to turn left, left calf to turn right. It takes a precise mix of shifting body weight, applying pressure with calves and rolling the shoulders. There are also handles for minor adjustments. A successful luger maintains complete concentration and relaxation on the sled while traveling at high speeds. Most lugers \"visualize\" the course in their minds before sliding.[citation needed] Fastest times result from following the perfect \"line\" down the track. Any slight error, such as brush against the wall, costs time. Track conditions are also important. Softer ice tends to slow speeds, while harder ice tends to lead to faster times. Lugers race at speeds averaging 120\u2013145\u00a0km/h (75\u201390\u00a0mph) around high banked curves while experiencing a centripetal acceleration of up to 5g. Men's Singles have their start locations near where the bobsled and skeleton competitors start at most tracks, while both the Doubles and Women's Singles competition have their starthouse located farther down the track. Artificial track luge is the fastest and most agile sledding sport.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.motionvideo.co.nz/kjhkj/extreme-sport-articles/extreme-sports-disicplines/293-lugel.html\", \"title\": \"Luge, extreme sport disciplines\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20160611010017/http://www.motionvideo.co.nz/kjhkj/extreme-sport-articles/extreme-sports-disicplines/293-lugel.html\", \"archivedate\": \"2016-06-11\"}\n\nNatural track luge\nNatural tracks are adapted from existing mountain roads and paths. Artificially banked curves are not permitted.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.fil-luge.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Documents/IRO/IRO_2014_NB_English_komplett_web.pdf\", \"title\": \"Rules of Natural Track Luge\", \"website\": \"FIL\"} The track's surface should be horizontal. They are naturally iced. Tracks can get rough from the braking and steering action. Athletes use a steering rein and drag their hands and use their legs in order to drive around the tight flat corners. Braking is often required in front of curves and is accomplished by the use of spikes built on the bottom of the shoes.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.motionvideo.co.nz/kjhkj/extreme-sport-articles/extreme-sports-disicplines/293-lugel.html\", \"title\": \"Luge, extreme sport disciplines\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20160611010017/http://www.motionvideo.co.nz/kjhkj/extreme-sport-articles/extreme-sports-disicplines/293-lugel.html\", \"archivedate\": \"2016-06-11\"} Tracks have a slope of not more than 15%.\nMost of the tracks are situated in Austria and Italy, with others in Germany, Poland, Russia, Slovenia, Canada, Switzerland, Croatia, Liechtenstein, France, Turkey, Sweden, Finland, Norway, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Romania, Slovakia, Czech Republic, New Zealand, Canada and the United States. \nThe Upper Peninsula Luge Club{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://upluge.org/\", \"title\": \"The Upper Peninsula Luge Club\", \"accessdate\": \"2015-03-03\"} in Negaunee, Michigan, is  the only natural luge track in the United States.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"2009-03-12\", \"title\": \"Negaunee Luge Hill Open for Public Use\", \"url\": \"http://www.thenorthwindonline.com/negaunee-luge-hill-open-for-public-use/\", \"work\": \"The North Wind\", \"location\": \"Northern Michigan University\", \"accessdate\": \"2015-03-03\", \"first \": \"Sarah\", \"last \": \"O'Neill\"} The over 800 meter (half-mile) track features 29 curves along its 88-meter (289\u00a0ft) vertical drop.

Physically, a luger must have strong neck, upper body, abdominal, and thigh muscles. Athletes also use Wind Tunnels to train{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://freshwater-and-saltwater.webnode.com/title=Rules to play Luge\", \"title\": \"Freshwater-and-saltwater\"} Strength training is essential to withstand the extreme G-forces of tight turns at high speeds. Since lugers have very little protection other than a visor and helmet, they must be able to endure the physical pounding administered by the track when mistakes are made.\n\nRisks\nAs with many extreme sports, luging has risks. Though most injuries involve bumps, bruises, broken bones and concussions, fatalities do occasionally occur. Georgian luger Nodar Kumaritashvili suffered a fatal crash during his final practice run for the 2010 Winter Olympics on the Whistler Sliding Centre in Whistler, British Columbia, Canada.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.cnn.com/2010/SPORT/02/12/olympic.luge.crash/index.html\", \"title\": \"Olympic Luger Dies on Track Where Speed Caused Concern\"} Hours later, the International Luge Federation concluded that the accident was caused by a steering error and not a track error; nevertheless, changes to the track were made before the re-opening.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.vancouver2010.com/olympic-news/n/news/fil-statement-on-mens-luge-competition_274462nE.html\", \"title\": \"Joint VANOC/FIL statement\", \"publisher\": \"Vancouver2010.com\", \"accessdate\": \"2011-11-25\"} Kumaritashvili was the fourth athlete to die while in preparation for a Winter Olympics competition, following speed skier Nicolas Bochatay, aged 27, who died while preparing for the Albertville 1992 games; and British luger Kazimierz Kay-Skrzypecki and skier Ross Milne, aged 19, who both died in the run-up to the Innsbruck 1964 games.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://freshwater-and-saltwater.webnode.com/title=Rules to play Luge\", \"title\": \"Freshwater-and-saltwater\"}\n\nGoverning body\nThe sport of luge is governed by the FIL, F\u00e9d\u00e9ration International de Luge de Course.
