    "content": "Surfing\n\nSurfing is a surface water pastime in which the wave rider, referred to as a surfer, rides on the forward part, or face, of a moving wave, which usually carries the surfer towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found in the ocean, but can also be found in lakes or rivers in the form of a standing wave or tidal bore. However, surfers can also utilize artificial waves such as those from boat wakes and the waves created in artificial wave pools.\nThe term surfing refers to the act of riding a wave with a board, regardless of the stance used. There are several types of boards. The native peoples of the Pacific, for instance, surfed waves on alaia, paipo, and other such craft, and did so on their belly and knees. The modern-day definition of surfing, however, most often refers to a surfer riding a wave standing on a surfboard; this is also referred to as stand-up surfing.\nAnother prominent form of surfing is body boarding, when a surfer rides the wave on a bodyboard, either lying on their belly, drop knee (one foot and one knee on the board), or sometimes even standing up on a body board. Other types of surfing include knee boarding, surf matting (riding inflatable mats), and using foils. Body surfing, where the wave is surfed without a board, using the surfer's own body to catch and ride the wave, is very common and is considered by some to be the purest form of surfing. The closest form of body surfing using a board is a handboard which normally has one strap over it to fit one hand in.\nThree major subdivisions within stand-up surfing are stand-up paddling, long boarding and short boarding with several major differences including the board design and length, the riding style, and the kind of wave that is ridden.\nIn tow-in surfing (most often, but not exclusively, associated with big wave surfing), a motorized water vehicle such as a personal watercraft, tows the surfer into the wave front helping the surfer match a large wave's speed, which is generally a higher speed than a self-propelled surfer can produce. Surfing-related sports such as paddle boarding and sea kayaking do not require waves, and other derivative sports such as kite surfing and windsurfing rely primarily on wind for power, yet all of these platforms may also be used to ride waves. Recently with the use of V-drive boats, Wakesurfing, in which one surfs on the wake of a boat, has emerged. The Guinness Book of World Records recognized a 23.8\u00a0m (78\u00a0ft) wave ride by Garrett McNamara at Nazar\u00e9, Portugal as the largest wave ever surfed.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"12 May 2012\", \"title\": \"Surfer rides World Record 24 m (78 ft) wave\", \"url\": \"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-18036392\", \"work\": \"BBC News\", \"accessdate\": \"29 January 2013\"}\n\nOrigins and history\nFor hundreds of years, surfing was a central part of ancient Polynesian culture. Surfing may have first been observed by British explorers at Tahiti in 1767. Samuel Wallis and the crew members of HMS\u00a0Dolphin were the first Britons to visit the island in June of that year. Another candidate is the botanist Joseph Banks[2] being part of the first voyage of James Cook on HMS\u00a0Endeavour, who arrived on Tahiti on 10 April 1769. Lieutenant James King was the first person to write about the art of surfing on Hawaii when he was completing the journals of Captain James Cook upon Cook's death in 1779.\nWhen Mark Twain visited Hawaii in 1866 he wrote,\nIn one place we came upon a large company of naked natives, of both sexes and all ages, amusing themselves with the national pastime of surf-bathing.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"2007\", \"title\": \"Roughing It\", \"url\": \"https://books.google.com/?id=gjUOvGeK51MC\", \"location\": \"Lawrence, Kansas\", \"publisher\": \"Digireads.com Publishing\", \"page\": \"264\", \"isbn\": \"9781420930283\", \"last\": \"Twain\", \"first\": \"Mark\"}References to surf riding on planks and single canoe hulls are also verified for pre-contact Samoa, where surfing was called fa'ase'e or se'egalu (see Augustin Kr\u00e4mer, The Samoa Islands{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"last1\": \"Kr\\u00e4mer\", \"first1\": \"Augustin\", \"year\": \"2000\", \"title\": \"The Samoa Islands\", \"url\": \"https://books.google.com/books?id=LHyUEUwaUdAC\", \"isbn\": \"9780824822194\", \"accessdate\": \"8 November 2014\"}), and Tonga, far pre-dating the practice of surfing by Hawaiians and eastern Polynesians by over a thousand years.\nIn July 1885, three teenage Hawaiian princes took a break from their boarding school, St. Mathew's Hall in San Mateo, and came to cool off in Santa Cruz, California. There, David Kaw\u0101nanakoa, Edward Keli\u02bbiahonui and Jonah K\u016bhi\u014d Kalaniana\u02bbole surfed the mouth of the San Lorenzo River on custom-shaped redwood boards, according to surf historians Kim Stoner and Geoff Dunn.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.gtweekly.com/santa-cruz-news/good-times-cover-stories/936-riders-of-the-sea-spray.html\", \"title\": \"Riders of the Sea Spray\", \"date\": \"31 March 2010\", \"website\": \"goodtimes.sc\", \"accessdate\": \"8 November 2014\", \"author1\": \"Geoffrey Dunn\", \"author2\": \"Kim Stoner\"} In 1890 the pioneer in agricultural education John Wrightson reputedly became the first British surfer when instructed by two Hawaiian students at his college.[6][7][8]\nGeorge Freeth (8 November 1883 \u2013 7 April 1919) is often credited as being the \"Father of Modern Surfing\". He is thought to have been the first modern surfer.\nIn 1907, the eclectic interests of the land baron Henry E. Huntington brought the ancient art of surfing to the California coast. While on vacation, Huntington had seen Hawaiian boys surfing the island waves. Looking for a way to entice visitors to the area of Redondo Beach, where he had heavily invested in real estate, he hired a young Hawaiian to ride surfboards. George Freeth decided to revive the art of surfing, but had little success with the huge 500\u00a0cm (16\u00a0ft) hardwood boards that were popular at that time. When he cut them in half to make them more manageable, he created the original \"Long board\", which made him the talk of the islands. To the delight of visitors, Freeth exhibited his surfing skills twice a day in front of the Hotel Redondo. Another native Hawaiian, Duke Kahanamoku, spread surfing to both the U.S. and Australia, riding the waves after displaying the swimming prowess that won him Olympic gold medals in 1912 and 1920.\nIn 1975, a professional tour started.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.surfingwalkoffame.com/woman/Oberg.html\", \"title\": \"Woman of the Year\", \"website\": \"Surfing Walk of Fame\", \"accessdate\": \"11 December 2017\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20170806224253/http://www.surfingwalkoffame.com/woman/Oberg.html\", \"archivedate\": \"6 August 2017\", \"df\": \"dmy-all\"} That year Margo Oberg became the first female professional surfer.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.surfingwalkoffame.com/woman/Oberg.html\", \"title\": \"Woman of the Year\", \"website\": \"Surfing Walk of Fame\", \"accessdate\": \"11 December 2017\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20170806224253/http://www.surfingwalkoffame.com/woman/Oberg.html\", \"archivedate\": \"6 August 2017\", \"df\": \"dmy-all\"}\n\nSurf waves\nSwell is generated when the wind blows consistently over a large area of open water, called the wind's fetch. The size of a swell is determined by the strength of the wind and the length of its fetch and duration. Because of this, the surf tends to be larger and more prevalent on coastlines exposed to large expanses of ocean traversed by intense low pressure systems.\nLocal wind conditions affect wave quality since the surface of a wave can become choppy in blustery conditions. Ideal conditions include a light to moderate \"offshore\" wind, because it blows into the front of the wave, making it a \"barrel\" or \"tube\" wave. Waves are Left handed and Right Handed depending upon the breaking formation of the wave.\nWaves are generally recognized by the surfaces over which they break.[10] For example, there are beach breaks, reef breaks and point breaks.\nThe most important influence on wave shape is the topography of the seabed directly behind and immediately beneath the breaking wave. The contours of the reef or bar front become stretched by diffraction. Each break is different since each location's underwater topography is unique. At beach breaks, sandbanks change shape from week to week. Surf forecasting is aided by advances in information technology. Mathematical modeling graphically depicts the size and direction of swells around the globe.\nSwell regularity varies across the globe and throughout the year. During winter, heavy swells are generated in the mid-latitudes, when the North and South polar fronts shift toward the Equator. The predominantly Westerly winds generate swells that advance Eastward, so waves tend to be largest on West coasts during winter months. However, an endless train of mid-latitude cyclones cause the isobars to become undulated, redirecting swells at regular intervals toward the tropics.\nEast coasts also receive heavy winter swells when low-pressure cells form in the sub-tropics, where slow moving highs inhibit their movement. These lows produce a shorter fetch than polar fronts, however, they can still generate heavy swells since their slower movement increases the duration of a particular wind direction. The variables of fetch and duration both influence how long wind acts over a wave as it travels since a wave reaching the end of a fetch behaves as if the wind died.\nDuring summer, heavy swells are generated when cyclones form in the tropics. Tropical cyclones form over warm seas, so their occurrence is influenced by El Ni\u00f1o & La Ni\u00f1a cycles. Their movements are unpredictable.\nSurf travel and some surf camps offer surfers access to remote, tropical locations, where tradewinds ensure offshore conditions. Since winter swells are generated by mid-latitude cyclones, their regularity coincides with the passage of these lows. Swells arrive in pulses, each lasting for a couple of days, with a few days between each swell.\nThe availability of free model data from the NOAA has allowed the creation of several surf forecasting websites.\n\nWave intensity\nTube shape is defined by length to width ratio. A perfectly cylindrical vortex has a ratio of 1:1. Other forms include:\nTube speed is defined by angle of peel line.\n\nArtificial reefs\nThe value of good surf in attracting surf tourism has prompted the construction of artificial reefs and sand bars. Artificial surfing reefs can be built with durable sandbags or concrete, and resemble a submerged breakwater. These artificial reefs not only provide a surfing location, but also dissipate wave energy and shelter the coastline from erosion. Ships such as Seli 1 that have accidentally stranded on sandy bottoms, can create sandbanks that give rise to good waves.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.zigzag.co.za/news/enviro/6709/Seli-1\", \"title\": \"Seli 1: One Year On\", \"date\": \"23 September 2009\", \"publisher\": \"Online Publishers Association South Africa\", \"accessdate\": \"25 May 2012\", \"work\": \"ZigZag\", \"author\": \"Clayton Truscott\"}\nAn artificial reef known as Chevron Reef was constructed in El Segundo, California in hopes of creating a new surfing area. However, the reef failed to produce any quality waves and was removed in 2008. In Kovalam, South West India, an artificial reef has, however, successfully provided the local community with a quality lefthander, stabilized coastal soil erosion, and provided good habitat for marine life.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"20 May 2010\", \"title\": \"India's first artificial reef to protect Kovalam\", \"url\": \"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Indias-first-artificial-reef-to-protect-Kovalam/articleshow/5951403.cms\", \"accessdate\": \"25 May 2012\", \"newspaper\": \"The Times Of India\", \"author\": \"TNN\"} ASR Ltd., a New Zealand-based company, constructed the Kovalam reef and is working on another reef in Boscombe, England.\n\nArtificial waves\nEven with artificial reefs in place, a tourist's vacation time may coincide with a \"flat spell\", when no waves are available. Completely artificial Wave pools aim to solve that problem by controlling all the elements that go into creating perfect surf, however there are only a handful of wave pools that can simulate good surfing waves, owing primarily to construction and operation costs and potential liability. Most wave pools generate waves that are too small and lack the power necessary to surf. The Seagaia Ocean Dome, located in Miyazaki, Japan, was an example of a surfable wave pool. Able to generate waves with up to 3\u00a0m (10\u00a0ft) faces, the specialized pump held water in 20 vertical tanks positioned along the back edge of the pool. This allowed the waves to be directed as they approach the artificial sea floor. Lefts, Rights, and A-frames could be directed from this pump design providing for rippable surf and barrel rides. The Ocean Dome cost about $2\u00a0billion to build and was expensive to maintain.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.surfline.com/mag/pulse/2000/nov/11_8_japan.cfm\", \"title\": \"MADE IN JAPAN Unlike its counterparts, Miyazaki's Ocean Dome wavepool is for real\", \"date\": \"8 November 2000\", \"publisher\": \"Surfline/Wavetrak, Inc\", \"accessdate\": \"25 May 2012\", \"author\": \"Duncan Scott\", \"work\": \"Surfline\"} The Ocean Dome was closed in 2007. In England, construction is nearing completion on the Wave,{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://thewave.com/Bristol/\", \"title\": \"Sustainable inland surfing destinations\", \"website\": \"The Wave Bristol\", \"accessdate\": \"11 December 2017\"} situated near Bristol, which will enable people unable to get to the coast to enjoy the waves in a controlled environment, set in the heart of nature.\nThere are two main types of artificial waves that exist today. One being artificial or stationary waves which simulate a moving, breaking wave by pumping a layer of water against a smooth structure mimicking the shape of a breaking wave. Because of the velocity of the rushing water the wave and the surfer can remain stationary while the water rushes by under the surfboard. Artificial waves of this kind provide the opportunity to try surfing and learn its basics in a moderately small and controlled environment near or far from locations with natural surf.\nAnother artificial wave can be made through use of a wave pool. These wave pools strive to make a wave that replicates a real ocean wave more than the stationary wave does. In 2018, the first professional surfing tournament in a wave pool was held.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"last1\": \"Rose\", \"first1\": \"Brent\", \"date\": \"10 May 2018\", \"title\": \"Is The First Pro Surfing Contest In A Wave Pool The Sport's Future, Or Its Bastardization?\", \"url\": \"https://deadspin.com/is-the-first-pro-surfing-contest-in-a-wave-pool-the-spo-1825848433#o6hi39el133n3an9yqmdatt1w.2sp2nmrdrwe13\", \"work\": \"[[Deadspin]]\", \"accessdate\": \"11 May 2018\"}\n\nSurfers and surf culture\nSurfers represent a diverse culture based on riding the waves. Some people practice surfing as a recreational activity while others make it the central focus of their lives. Surfing culture is most dominant in Hawaii and California because these two states offer the best surfing conditions. However, waves can be found wherever there is coastline, and a tight-knit yet far-reaching subculture of surfers has emerged throughout America. Some historical markers of the culture included the woodie, the station wagon used to carry surfers' boards, as well as boardshorts, the long swim shorts typically worn while surfing. Surfers also wear wetsuits in colder regions.\nThe sport is also a significant part of Australia's eastern coast sub-cultural life [16], especially in New South Wales, where the weather and water conditions are most favourable for surfing.\nDuring the 1960s, as surfing caught on in California, its popularity spread through American pop culture. Several teen movies, starting with the Gidget series in 1959, transformed surfing into a dream life for American youth. Later movies, including Beach Party (1963), Ride the Wild Surf (1964), and Beach Blanket Bingo (1965) promoted the California dream of sun and surf.  Surf culture also fueled the early records of the Beach Boys.\nThe sport of surfing now represents a multibillion-dollar industry especially in clothing and fashion markets. The World Surf League (WSL) runs the championship tour, hosting top competitors in some of the best surf spots around the globe. A small number of people make a career out of surfing by receiving corporate sponsorships and performing for photographers and videographers in far-flung destinations; they are typically referred to as freesurfers. Sixty-six surfboarders on a 13\u00a0m (42\u00a0ft) long surfboard set a record in Huntington Beach, California for most people on a surfboard at one time. Dale Webster consecutively surfed for 14,641 days, making it his main life focus.\nWhen the waves were flat, surfers persevered with sidewalk surfing, which is now called skateboarding. Sidewalk surfing has a similar feel to surfing and requires only a paved road or sidewalk. To create the feel of the wave, surfers even sneak into empty backyard swimming pools to ride in, known as pool skating. Eventually, surfing made its way to the slopes with the invention of the Snurfer, later credited as the first snowboard. Many other board sports have been invented over the years, but all can trace their heritage back to surfing.\nMany surfers claim to have a spiritual connection with the ocean, describing surfing, the surfing experience, both in and out of the water, as a type of spiritual experience or a religion.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/03/religion-of-surfing_n_5617472.html\", \"title\": \"The Spirituality Of Surfing: Finding Religion Riding The Waves\", \"date\": \"3 August 2014\", \"publisher\": \"huffingtonpost.com\", \"accessdate\": \"26 August 2015\"}\n\nManeuvers\nStandup surfing begins when the surfer paddles toward shore in an attempt to match the speed of the wave (the same applies whether the surfer is standup paddling, bodysurfing, boogie-boarding or using some other type of watercraft, such as a waveski or kayak). Once the wave begins to carry the surfer forward, the surfer stands up and proceeds to ride the wave. The basic idea is to position the surfboard so it is just ahead of the breaking part (whitewash) of the wave. A common problem for beginners is being able to catch the wave at all.\nSurfers' skills are tested by their ability to control their board in difficult conditions, riding challenging waves, and executing maneuvers such as strong turns and cutbacks (turning board back to the breaking wave) and carving (a series of strong back-to-back maneuvers). More advanced skills include the floater (riding on top of the breaking curl of the wave), and off the lip (banking off the breaking wave). A newer addition to surfing is the progression of the air whereby a surfer propels off the wave entirely up into the air, and then successfully lands the board back on the wave.\nThe tube ride is considered to be the ultimate maneuver in surfing. As a wave breaks, if the conditions are ideal, the wave will break in an orderly line from the middle to the shoulder, enabling the experienced surfer to position themselves inside the wave as it is breaking. This is known as a tube ride. Viewed from the shore, the tube rider may disappear from view as the wave breaks over the rider's head. The longer the surfer remains in the tube, the more successful the ride. This is referred to as getting tubed, barrelled, shacked or pitted. Some of the world's best known waves for tube riding include Pipeline on the North shore of Oahu, Teahupoo in Tahiti and G-Land in Java. Other names for the tube include \"the barrel\", and \"the pit\".\nHanging ten and hanging five are moves usually specific to long boarding. Hanging Ten refers to having both feet on the front end of the board with all of the surfer's toes off the edge, also known as nose-riding. Hanging Five is having just one foot near the front, with five toes off the edge.\nCutback: Generating speed down the line and then turning back to reverse direction.\nFloater: Suspending the board atop the wave. Very popular on small waves.\nTop-Turn: Turn off the top of the wave. Sometimes used to generate speed and sometimes to shoot spray.\nAirs/Aerials: These maneuvers have been becoming more and more prevalent in the sport in both competition and free surfing. An air is when the surfer can achieve enough speed and approach a certain type of section of a wave that is supposed to act as a ramp and launch the surfer above the lip line of the wave, \u201ccatching air\u201d, and landing either in the transition of the wave or the whitewash when hitting a close-out section.\nAirs can either be straight airs or rotational airs. Straight airs have minimal rotation if any, but definitely no more rotation than 90 degrees. Rotational airs require a rotation of 90 degrees or more depending on the level of the surfer.\nTypes of rotations:\n\nTerms\nThe Glossary of surfing includes some of the extensive vocabulary used to describe various aspects of the sport of surfing as described in literature on the subject.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"1996\", \"chapter\": \"Appendix A \\u2013 Hawaiian Surfing terms\", \"title\": \"Surfing \\u2013 A History of the Ancient Hawaiian Sport\", \"location\": \"Rohnett, CA\", \"publisher\": \"Pomegranate Artbooks\", \"pages\": \"94\\u201397\", \"isbn\": \"978-0-87654-594-2\", \"last\": \"Finney\", \"first\": \"Ben\", \"author2\": \"Houston, James D.\"}{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"2003\", \"chapter\": \"Appendix A \\u2013 Glossary of Surfing Lingo\", \"title\": \"The Art of Surfing: A Training Manual for the Developing and Competitive Surfer\", \"location\": \"Guilford, CT\", \"publisher\": \"Globe Pequot Press\", \"pages\": \"165\\u20130170\", \"isbn\": \"978-0-7627-2466-6\", \"last\": \"Guisado\", \"first\": \"Raul\"} In some cases terms have spread to a wider cultural use. These terms were originally coined by people who were directly involved in the sport of surfing.\n\nLearning\nMany popular surfing destinations have surf schools and surf camps that offer lessons. Surf camps for beginners and intermediates are multi-day lessons that focus on surfing fundamentals. They are designed to take new surfers and help them become proficient riders. All-inclusive surf camps offer overnight accommodations, meals, lessons and surfboards. Most surf lessons begin with instruction and a safety briefing on land, followed by instructors helping students into waves on longboards or \"softboards\". The softboard is considered the ideal surfboard for learning, due to the fact it is safer, and has more paddling speed and stability than shorter boards. Funboards are also a popular shape for beginners as they combine the volume and stability of the longboard with the manageable size of a smaller surfboard.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://hvsboardsport.com/howtosurf/\", \"title\": \"How to surf; learn to surf in one day\", \"date\": \"20 November 2017\", \"website\": \"hvsboardsport.com\", \"publisher\": \"Hvs Boardsport\", \"accessdate\": \"20 November 2017\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20171201131256/https://hvsboardsport.com/howtosurf/\", \"archivedate\": \"1 December 2017\", \"author\": \"Kristian Hansen\"} New and inexperienced surfers typically learn to catch waves on softboards around the 210 to 240\u00a0cm (7 to 8\u00a0ft) funboard size. Due to the softness of the surfboard the chance of getting injured is substantially minimized.\nTypical surfing instruction is best performed one-on-one, but can also be done in a group setting. The most popular surf locations offer perfect surfing conditions for beginners, as well as challenging breaks for advanced students. The ideal conditions for learning would be small waves that crumble and break softly, as opposed to the steep, fast-peeling waves desired by more experienced surfers. When available, a sandy seabed is generally safer.\nSurfing can be broken into several skills: Paddling strength, Positioning to catch the wave, timing, and balance. Paddling out requires strength, but also the mastery of techniques to break through oncoming waves (duck diving, eskimo roll). Take-off positioning requires experience at predicting the wave set and where they will break. The surfer must pop up quickly as soon as the wave starts pushing the board forward. Preferred positioning on the wave is determined by experience at reading wave features including where the wave is breaking.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.learnhowtosurf.info/how-to-surf/\", \"title\": \"The quick guide on how to surf\", \"publisher\": \"learnhowtosurf.info\", \"accessdate\": \"26 August 2015\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20120831054300/http://www.learnhowtosurf.info/how-to-surf/\", \"archivedate\": \"31 August 2012\", \"df\": \"dmy-all\"} Balance plays a crucial role in standing on a surfboard. Thus, balance training exercises are a good preparation. Practicing with a Balance board or swing boarding helps novices master the art.\nThe repetitive cycle of paddling, popping up, and balancing requires stamina, explosivity, and near-constant core stabilization. Having a proper warm up routine can help prevent injuries.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"2017-08-01\", \"title\": \"Warm Up So You Don't Wipe Out\", \"url\": \"https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/a19528572/torrey-meister-warm-up-us-open-surfing/\", \"work\": \"Men's Health\", \"language\": \"en-US\", \"accessdate\": \"2018-11-13\"}\n\nEquipment\nSurfing can be done on various equipment, including surfboards, longboards, stand up paddle boards (SUPs), bodyboards, wave skis, skimboards, kneeboards, surf mats and macca's trays. Surfboards were originally made of solid wood and were large and heavy (often up to 370\u00a0cm (12\u00a0ft) long and having a mass of 70\u00a0kg (150\u00a0lb)). Lighter balsa wood surfboards (first made in the late 1940s and early 1950s) were a significant improvement, not only in portability, but also in increasing maneuverability.\nMost modern surfboards are made of fiberglass foam (PU), with one or more wooden strips or \"stringers\", fiberglass cloth, and polyester resin (PE). An emerging board material is epoxy resin and Expanded Polystyrene foam (EPS) which is stronger and lighter than traditional PU/PE construction. Even newer designs incorporate materials such as carbon fiber and variable-flex composites in conjunction with fiberglass and epoxy or polyester resins. Since epoxy/EPS surfboards are generally lighter, they will float better than a traditional PU/PE board of similar size, shape and thickness. This makes them easier to paddle and faster in the water. However, a common complaint of EPS boards is that they do not provide as much feedback as a traditional PU/PE board. For this reason, many advanced surfers prefer that their surfboards be made from traditional materials.\nOther equipment includes a leash (to stop the board from drifting away after a wipeout, and to prevent it from hitting other surfers), surf wax, traction pads (to keep a surfer's feet from slipping off the deck of the board), and fins (also known as skegs) which can either be permanently attached (glassed-on) or interchangeable. Sportswear designed or particularly suitable for surfing may be sold as boardwear (the term is also used in snowboarding). In warmer climates, swimsuits, surf trunks or boardshorts are worn, and occasionally rash guards; in cold water surfers can opt to wear wetsuits, boots, hoods, and gloves to protect them against lower water temperatures. A newer introduction is a rash vest with a thin layer of titanium to provide maximum warmth without compromising mobility. In recent years, there have been advancements in technology that have allowed surfers to pursue even bigger waves with added elements of safety. Big wave surfers are now experimenting with inflatable vests or colored dye packs to help decrease their odds of drowning.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"last1\": \"Surfer\", \"date\": \"15 September 2014\", \"title\": \"Bigger and Better\", \"url\": \"http://www.surfermag.com/features/big-wave-surfing-innovations/\", \"work\": \"Surfer Magazine\", \"publisher\": \"Surfer Magazine\", \"accessdate\": \"29 December 2014\", \"ref\": \"http://www.surfermag.com/author/surfer/\"}\nThere are many different surfboard sizes, shapes, and designs in use today. Modern longboards, generally 270 to 300\u00a0cm (9 to 10\u00a0ft) in length, are reminiscent of the earliest surfboards, but now benefit from modern innovations in surfboard shaping and fin design. Competitive longboard surfers need to be competent at traditional walking manoeuvres, as well as the short-radius turns normally associated with shortboard surfing. The modern shortboard began life in the late 1960s and has evolved into today's common thruster style, defined by its three fins, usually around 180 to 210\u00a0cm (6 to 7\u00a0ft) in length. The thruster was invented by Australian shaper Simon Anderson.\nMidsize boards, often called funboards, provide more maneuverability than a longboard, with more flotation than a shortboard. While many surfers find that funboards live up to their name, providing the best of both surfing modes, others are critical.\nThere are also various niche styles, such as the Egg, a longboard-style short board targeted for people who want to ride a shortboard but need more paddle power. The Fish, a board which is typically shorter, flatter, and wider than a normal shortboard, often with a split tail (known as a swallow tail). The Fish often has two or four fins and is specifically designed for surfing smaller waves. For big waves there is the Gun, a long, thick board with a pointed nose and tail (known as a pin tail) specifically designed for big waves.\n\nThe physics of surfing\nThe physics of surfing involves the physical oceanographic properties of wave creation in the surf zone, the characteristics of the surfboard, and the surfer's interaction with the water and the board.\n\nWave formation\nOcean waves are defined as a collection of dislocated water parcels that undergo a cycle of being forced past their normal position and being restored back to their normal position.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"date\": \"2011\", \"chapter\": \"Chapter 8.

Shallow wave's wavelengths are long relative to water depth and have elliptical orbitals. The wave velocity effects the entire water basin. The water interacts with the bottom as it approaches shore and has a drag interaction. The drag interaction pulls on the bottom of the wave, causes refraction, increases the height, decreases the celerity (or the speed of the wave form), and the top (crest) falls over. This phenomenon happens because the velocity of the top of the wave is greater than the velocity of the bottom of the wave.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"date\": \"2011\", \"chapter\": \"Chapter 8.

Surf breaks entail multiple scale phenomena. Wave section creation has micro-scale factors of peel angle and wave breaking intensity. The micro-scale components influence wave height and variations on wave crests. The mesoscale components of surf breaks are the ramp, platform, wedge, or ledge that may be present at a surf break. Macro-scale processes are the global winds that initially produce offshore waves.

This type of jetty is significantly longer than the surf zone width and the waves break at the shore end of the jetty. The effect of a Type 1 jetty is sediment accumulation in a wedge formation on the jetty. These waves are large and increase in size as they pass over the sediment wedge formation. An example of a Type 1 jetty is Mission Beach, San Diego, California. This 1000-meter jetty was installed in 1950 at the mouth of Mission Bay. The surf waves happen north of the jetty, are longer waves, and are powerful. The bathymetry of the sea bottom in Mission Bay has a wedge shape formation that causes the waves to refract as they become closer to the jetty.{\"citetype\": \"journal\", \"last1\": \"Scarfe\", \"first1\": \"B.E.\", \"date\": \"7 March 2003\", \"title\": \"Categorizing the Types of Surfing Breaks around Jetty Structures\", \"url\": \"http://escholarship.org/uc/item/09f405bq\", \"journal\": \"Scripps Institution of Oceanography Technical Report\", \"pages\": \"1\\u20138\", \"author2\": \"M.H.S.

However, \"The Poles\" has larger than normal waves due to a 500-meter jetty that was installed on the south side of the St. Johns. This jetty was built to make a deep channel in the river. It formed a delta at \"The Poles\". This is special area because the jetty increases wave size for surfing, when comparing pre-conditions and post-conditions of the southern St. Johns River mouth area.{\"citetype\": \"journal\", \"last1\": \"Scarfe\", \"first1\": \"B.E.\", \"date\": \"7 March 2003\", \"title\": \"Categorizing the Types of Surfing Breaks around Jetty Structures\", \"url\": \"http://escholarship.org/uc/item/09f405bq\", \"journal\": \"Scripps Institution of Oceanography Technical Report\", \"pages\": \"1\\u20138\", \"author2\": \"M.H.S.

When easterly waters (from 55\u00b0) interact with the jetty, they create waves larger than southern waters (from 100\u00b0). When southern waves (from 100\u00b0) move toward \"The Poles\", one of the waves breaks north of the southern jetty and the other breaks south of the jetty. This does not allow for merging to make larger waves. Easterly waves, from 55\u00b0, converge north of the jetty and unite to make bigger waves.{\"citetype\": \"journal\", \"last1\": \"Scarfe\", \"first1\": \"B.E.\", \"date\": \"7 March 2003\", \"title\": \"Categorizing the Types of Surfing Breaks around Jetty Structures\", \"url\": \"http://escholarship.org/uc/item/09f405bq\", \"journal\": \"Scripps Institution of Oceanography Technical Report\", \"pages\": \"1\\u20138\", \"author2\": \"M.H.S.

The Boundary Interaction Model assumes that the topography of the sea bottom causes nearshore circulation and longshore transport; the result of both models is a rip current.{\"citetype\": \"journal\", \"date\": \"1978\", \"title\": \"Rip Currents and Their Causes\", \"url\": \"https://journals.tdl.org/icce/index.php/icce/article/viewArticle/3345\", \"journal\": \"Coastal Engineering\", \"volume\": \"1\", \"issue\": \"16\", \"pages\": \"1414\\u20131427\", \"last\": \"Dalrymple\", \"first\": \"Robert A.\"}\nRip currents can be extremely strong and narrow as they extend out of the surf zone into deeper water, reaching speeds from 0.5\u00a0m/s (1.6\u00a0ft/s) and up to 2.5\u00a0m/s (8.2\u00a0ft/s),{\"citetype\": \"journal\", \"last1\": \"Smith\", \"first1\": \"Jerome A.\", \"date\": \"1995\", \"title\": \"Observations of nearshore circulation: Rip currents\", \"url\": \"http://opg1.ucsd.edu/pdfs/smith/1995-jgro100-SmithLargier-NrShrRips.pdf\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"journal\": \"Journal of Geophysical Research\", \"volume\": \"100\", \"issue\": \"C6\", \"pages\": \"10967\\u201310975\", \"bibcode\": \"1995JGR...10010967S\", \"doi\": \"10.1029/95JC00751\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20150918183502/http://opg1.ucsd.edu/pdfs/smith/1995-jgro100-SmithLargier-NrShrRips.pdf\", \"archivedate\": \"2015-09-18\", \"author2\": \"John L.

Under the wrong circumstances these currents can endanger both experienced and inexperienced surfers. Since a rip current appears to be an area of flat water, tired or inexperienced swimmers or surfers may enter one and be carried out beyond the breaking waves. Although many rip currents are much smaller, the largest rip currents have a width of forty or fifty feet. However, by paddling parallel to the shore, a surfer can easily exit a rip current. Alternatively, some surfers actually ride on a rip current because it is a fast and effortless way to get out beyond the zone of breaking waves.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"7 September 2001\", \"title\": \"Surfing's hidden dangers\", \"url\": \"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/1530767.stm\", \"work\": \"BBC News\", \"accessdate\": \"24 May 2010\"}\n\nSeabed\nThe seabed can pose a risk for surfers. If a surfer falls while riding a wave, the wave tosses and tumbles the surfer around, often in a downwards direction. At reef breaks and beach breaks, surfers have been seriously injured and even killed, because of a violent collision with the sea bed, the water above which can sometimes be very shallow, especially at beach breaks or reef breaks during low tide. Cyclops, Western Australia, for example, is one of the biggest and thickest reef breaks in the world, with waves measuring up to 10\u00a0m (33\u00a0ft) high, but the reef below is only about 2\u00a0m (7\u00a0ft) below the surface of the water.\n\nMicroorganisms\nA January 2018 study by the University of Exeter called the \"Beach Bum Survey\" found surfers and bodyboarders to be three times as likely as non-surfers to harbor antibiotic-resistant E. coli and four times as likely to harbor other bacteria capable of easily becoming antibiotic resistant. The researchers attributed this to the fact that surfers swallow roughly ten times as much seawater as swimmers.{\"citetype\": \"journal\", \"last1\": \"Leonard\", \"first1\": \"Anne F.C.\", \"last2\": \"Zhang\", \"first2\": \"Lihong\", \"last3\": \"Balfour\", \"first3\": \"Andrew J.\", \"last4\": \"Garside\", \"first4\": \"Ruth\", \"last5\": \"Hawkey\", \"first5\": \"Peter M.\", \"date\": \"14 January 2018\", \"title\": \"Exposure to and colonisation by antibiotic-resistant E. coli in UK coastal water users: Environmental surveillance, exposure assessment, and epidemiological study (Beach Bum Survey)\", \"journal\": \"Environment International\", \"volume\": \"114\", \"pages\": \"326\\u2013333\", \"doi\": \"10.1016/j.envint.2017.11.003\", \"last6\": \"Murray\", \"first6\": \"Aimee K.\", \"last7\": \"Ukoumunne\", \"first7\": \"Obioha C.\", \"last8\": \"Gaze\", \"first8\": \"William H.\"}{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"work\": \"Eurekalert\", \"accessdate\": \"15 January 2018\", \"url    \": \"https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-01/uoe-stt011118.php\", \"title  \": \"Surfers three times more likely to have antibiotic-resistant bacteria in guts\", \"author \": \"University of Exeter\", \"date   \": \"14 January 2018\"}\n\nEar damage\nSurfers should use ear protection such as ear plugs to avoid surfer's ear, inflammation of the ear or other damage. Surfer's ear is where the bone near the ear canal grows after repeated exposure to cold water, making the ear canal narrower. The narrowed canal makes it harder for water to drain from the ear. This can result in pain, infection and sometimes ringing of the ear. If surfer's ear develops it does so after repeated surfing sessions. Yet, damage such as inflammation of the ear can occur after only surfing once. This can be caused by repeatedly falling off the surfboard into the water and having the cold water rush into the ears, which can exert a damaging amount of pressure. Those with sensitive ears should therefore wear ear protection, even if they are not planning to surf very often.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"4 April 2014\", \"title\": \"Surfer's Ear \\u2013 An Inconvenient Truth\", \"url\": \"https://magicseaweed.com/news/surfers-ear-an-inconvenient-truth/6276/\", \"work\": \"MSW\", \"accessdate\": \"15 July 2018\"}\nEar plugs designed for surfers, swimmers and other water athletes are primarily made to keep water out of the ear, thereby letting a protective pocket of air stay inside the ear canal. They can also block cold air, dirt and bacteria. Many designs are made to let sound through, and either float and/or have a leash in case the plug accidentally gets bumped out.[50][51]\n\nEye damage\nSurfer's eye (Pterygium (conjunctiva)) is a gradual tissue growth on the cornea of the eye which ultimately can lead to vision loss. The cause of the condition is unclear, but appears to be partly related to long term exposure to UV light, dust and wind exposure. Prevention may include wearing sunglasses and a hat if in an area with strong sunlight. Surfers and other water-sport athletes should therefore wear eye protection that blocks 100% of the UV rays from the water, as is often used by snow-sport athletes. Surf goggles often have a head strap and ventilation to avoid fogging[52][53]\nUsers of contact lenses should take extra care, and may consider wearing surfing goggles. Some risks of exposing contact lenses to the elements that can cause eye damage or infections are sand or organisms in the sea water getting between the eye and contact lens, or that lenses might fold.[54][55]\n\nSpinal cord\nSurfer's myelopathy is a rare spinal cord injury causing paralysis of the lower extremities, caused by hyperextension of the back. This is due to one of the main blood vessels of the spine becoming kinked, depriving the spinal cord of oxygen. In some cases the paralysis is permanent. Although any activity where the back is arched can cause this condition (i.e. yoga, pilates, etc.), this rare phenomenon has most often been seen in those surfing for the first time. According to DPT Sergio Florian, some recommendations for preventing myelopathy is proper warm up, limiting the session length and sitting on the board while waiting for waves, rather than lying.[56]\n\nGallery\nBeginner surfer in Pacific Beach, California\nSurfer in Pacific Beach, California\nA day of big surf in La Jolla, California\nBig surf in La Jolla, California\nVery big surf in La Jolla, California\nOops, La Jolla, California\n",
