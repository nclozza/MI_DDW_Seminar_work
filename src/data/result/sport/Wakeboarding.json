    "content": "Wakeboarding\nWakeboarding is a water sport in which the rider, standing on a wakeboard (a short board with foot bindings), is towed behind a motorboat across its wake and especially up off the crest in order to perform aerial maneuvers.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/wakeboard\", \"title\": \"Definition of WAKEBOARD\", \"website\": \"www.merriam-webster.com\", \"language\": \"en\"} A hallmark of wakeboarding is the attempted performance of midair tricks.\nThe rider is usually towed by a rope behind a boat, but can also be towed by cable systems and winches, and be pulled by other motorized vehicles like personal watercraft, cars, trucks, and all-terrain vehicles. The gear and wakeboard boat used are often personalized to each rider's liking.\nWakeboarding is done for pleasure and competition, ranging from freestyle wakeboarding and wakeboard parks to wakeboard competitions at the X Games, WWA Wakeboard World Championships, or similar events.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.fise.fr/fr/wakeboard-pro-top-5-fise-montpellier-2019\", \"title\": \"Wakeboard Pro Top 5 {{!}} FISE Montpellier 2019 {{!}} FISE\", \"website\": \"www.fise.fr\"}\n\nHistory\nThe sport that would later become wakeboarding began as wakesurfing, which was invented by surfers who were looking for an alternative to surfing when the sea was calm. Wakesurfing began picking up traction around 1964, where it was seen as an \"exciting new sport that's soon going to sweep the waterways.\"[3] Although surfboards were originally used, boards without straps or bindings were first seen in New Zealand with boards called \"skurfboards\".[citation needed] Eventually, wakeboards with bindings or straps were sold in Australia under the name \"McSkis\". Later, another company called \"Skurfer\" was founded by Tony Finn in 1985,{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://unleashedwakemag.com/tony-finn-inventor-wakeboarding/\", \"title\": \"TONY FINN {{!}} Inventor of wakeboarding {{!}}\", \"date\": \"2016-12-11\", \"website\": \"Unleashed Wake Mag\", \"language\": \"en-US\"} named as such due to the board being a cross of a surfboard and a water ski. The first board made in the early 1990s was the Hyperlite board by the O\u2019Brien company,{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://obrien.com/obrien-wakeboards/\", \"title\": \"O'Brien Wakeboards\", \"website\": \"O'Brien Watersports - Our World Is Water\", \"language\": \"en-US\"}[better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] a water ski manufacturer who marketed the board as a \u201ccompression-molded neutral-buoyancy wakeboard.\u201d{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.usawaterski.org/pages/divisions/wakeboard/WakeboardHistory.htm\", \"title\": \"Wakeboard\", \"website\": \"www.usawaterski.org\"} This was followed by a variety of boards that are curvier and more compact, creating a smoother ride.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.usawaterski.org/pages/divisions/wakeboard/WakeboardHistory.htm\", \"title\": \"Wakeboard\", \"website\": \"www.usawaterski.org\"}\nThe wakeboard rope has advanced over the years with improvements in the material makeup. When wakeboarding first started, wakeboarders used ski rope, which was made with stretchy cloth or plastic ropes. The latter soon grew in popularity, and a braided rope made out of polypropylene was eventually introduced. A few years later[when?], a rope that was less stretchy was invented that gave the rider a more consistent pull on the rope, though they were heavier and larger in diameter. Modern ropes are coated with Spectra and Dyneema, which decrease the stretch and drag of the rope.\n\nEquipment\nWhen wakeboarding, a wide variety of safety equipment is used. These include life vests or other buoyancy aids which prevent water-related injuries and deaths, as they keep the wearer buoyant until they are picked up. These vests especially help in situations where the rider is knocked unconscious or cannot tread water.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://mpora.com/wakeboarding/wakeboarding-beginners-gear\", \"title\": \"What Essential Wakeboarding Gear Do I Need?\", \"website\": \"Mpora\", \"language\": \"en-US\"} Furthermore, wakeboarders use water-resistant helmets that are able to ventilate water so that the helmets do not fill up with water.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://mpora.com/wakeboarding/wakeboarding-beginners-gear\", \"title\": \"What Essential Wakeboarding Gear Do I Need?\", \"website\": \"Mpora\", \"language\": \"en-US\"} Even the length of a wakeboarder's rope is important in providing safety; if the rope is too long, a wakeboarder will land on the flat part of the wake instead of the downside, and their knees will buckle.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://culture.evo.com/2013/05/wakeboard-boating-tips-towing-speed-rope-length-weighting-your-boat-properly/\", \"title\": \"Wakeboard Boating Tips: Towing Speed, Rope length & Weighting\", \"date\": \"2013-05-15\", \"website\": \"evo Culture, Community, Cause\", \"language\": \"en-US\"}\nAt the same time, the length of a wakeboarding rope will vary based on the rider's preferences. A longer rope may allow for more preparation and momentum before performing tricks,{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://humanoidwake.com/wakeboard-rope/\", \"title\": \"Adjusting your wakeboard rope is the best kept secret to crush your trick list.\", \"date\": \"2018-08-15\", \"website\": \"Humanoid Wakeboards\", \"language\": \"en-US\"} whereas a shorter rope may require less speed and height to travel between wakes.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://humanoidwake.com/wakeboard-rope/\", \"title\": \"Adjusting your wakeboard rope is the best kept secret to crush your trick list.\", \"date\": \"2018-08-15\", \"website\": \"Humanoid Wakeboards\", \"language\": \"en-US\"}\n\nTricks\nWhen wakeboarding, a variety of tricks may be attempted. Most of these stem from the wakeboarder adjusting their posture, edge, and distribution of weight so as to fly into the air upon hitting the wake.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.wakeboarder.com/display.phtml?a=59\", \"title\": \"Learn The Progressive Toeside Edge - Wakeboarder.com Wakeboarding News\", \"website\": \"www.wakeboarder.com\"} Various tricks include the toeside edge,{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.wakeboarder.com/display.phtml?a=59\", \"title\": \"Learn The Progressive Toeside Edge - Wakeboarder.com Wakeboarding News\", \"website\": \"www.wakeboarder.com\"} the heelside edge,{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.wakeboarder.com/display.phtml?a=50\", \"title\": \"Learn the Progressive Heelside Edge - Wakeboarder.com Wakeboarding News\", \"website\": \"www.wakeboarder.com\"} the ride switch,{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.wakeboarder.com/display.phtml?a=35\", \"title\": \"Learning To Ride Switch - Wakeboarder.com Wakeboarding News\", \"website\": \"www.wakeboarder.com\"} and the 180\u00b0 spin.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.wakeboarder.com/display.phtml?a=33\", \"title\": \"Progressive Steps to Learn 180s - Wakeboarder.com Wakeboarding News\", \"website\": \"www.wakeboarder.com\"}\nMore advanced tricks call for what is known as inversion or \u201cinverts\u201d. An invert is considered any action where the board is above the head of the rider. This does not necessarily mean the rider is fully upside down, as evidenced by the Raley, a trick where the rider extends their body parallel to the water bending at the knees to achieve inversion.[14]\nThe heel side backflip, otherwise known as a tantrum, is often regarded as the first and easiest invert to learn as an intermediate level rider. This is because the shape of the wake or the \u201ckicker\u201d (a type of floating ramp, used primarily at cable parks, that mimics the shape of a wake) naturally initiates the sequence of motions which are necessary to complete the trick.
