{"url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubb", "content": "Kubb\nKubb (pronounced [k\u0275b\u02d0] in Swedish or [kub\u02d0] in Gutnish) is a lawn game where the objective is to knock over wooden blocks (kubbs) by throwing wooden batons (kastpinnar) at them. Kubb can be described as a combination of bowling and horseshoes. Play takes place on a small rectangular playing field, known as a \"pitch\". \"Kubbs\" are placed at both ends of the pitch, and the \"king\", a larger wooden block, is placed in the middle of the pitch. Some rules vary from country to country and from region to region, but the ultimate objective of the game is to knock over the \"kubbs\" on the opposing side of the pitch, and then to knock over the \"king\", before the opponent does. Games can last from five minutes to well over an hour. The game can be played on a variety of surfaces such as grass, sand, concrete, snow, or even ice.\nThe alleged Viking origin of the game has led some players and kubb fans to nickname the game \u201cViking chess\u201d.\n\nHistory\nIt is often claimed that the game dates back to the Viking Age and has survived since then on the Swedish island of Gotland, although there is no evidence of this.  The F\u00f6reningen Gutnisk Idrott (\"Society (of) Gotland Games\"), formed in 1912, does not list kubb as one of the traditional games from Gotland. \nThe earliest mention of a kubb-like game comes from the second edition of the Swedish Encyclopedia \u201cNordisk familjebok\u201d (the Nordic familybook) in 1911. It's there called \"K\u00e4gelkrig\" (Skittles war) and is described as a variation of skittles and played with a ball. [1] The game in its modern conception became popular in the late 1980s when commercial kubb sets were first manufactured. \nThe key feature of the game (opposing teams throwing) is shared by the games kyykk\u00e4 and bunnock, both of which come from Karelia or neighbouring areas. The game has now gained international interest, and an annual World Championship has been held since 1995 on Gotland. Large kubb tournaments now occur throughout Europe and the United States of America. Belgium alone held over 50 tournaments in 2012.\nOn December 13, 2011, Eau Claire, Wisconsin declared itself to be the 'Kubb Capital of North America'.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://volumeone.org/news/1/posts/2011/12/14/2826_Welcome_to_the_Kubb_Capitol_of_North_America\", \"title\": \"Welcome to the \\u201cKubb Capital of North America\\u201d\", \"last\": \"Paulus\", \"first\": \"Mike\"} The city has hosted the U.S. National Kubb Championship since 2007, and is home to Kubbnation Magazine and many clubs and leagues, including the Eau Claire Kubb League, which is the largest weekly kubb league in the world. In addition, kubb sets are in the local schools, with some schools having kubb units in physical education classes and kubb clubs.\n\nGame pieces\nThere are typically twenty-three game pieces used in kubb:[3]\n\nSetup\nAccording to the US Championship Rules and World Championship Rules, kubb is played on a rectangular pitch 5 metres by 8 metres. Corner stakes are placed so that a rectangle is formed. The center stakes are placed in the middle of the sidelines (long edges of the rectangle), which divides the pitch into two halves. No other markers are required to demarcate the field's boundaries, although markings that do not interfere with game play are allowed (such as chalk lines). The king is placed upright in the center of the pitch, and the kubbs are placed on the baselines (short edges of the rectangle), five kubbs on each side equidistant from each other. Kubbs starting the game on the baseline are referred to as base kubbs. The baseline should run through the center of the kubbs.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.usakubb.org/resources/US_National_Kubb_Championship_Rules_v3.0.pdf\", \"title\": \"U.S. Nationals Rules\", \"publisher\": \"U.S. National Kubb Championship\"} For young children, the 8-meter pitch length can be shortened.\n\nRulesets\nTwo official tournament rulesets available for kubb are the World Championship Rules and the U.S. National Championship Rules.[5][6]\n\nPlay overview\nKubb is played between two teams, which may consist of only one person per team.\nThere are two phases for each team's turn:\nIf a kubb is thrown out of play, i.e., outside the boundary markers or not beyond the middle line (Note: after being raised, at least half of the kubb must be in the field of play to be considered in play), then one more attempt is given. If this also goes out, the kubb becomes a \"punishment kubb\" and can be placed anywhere in the target half by the opposing team as long as it is at least one baton length from a corner marker or the King.\nIf a thrown kubb knocks over an existing baseline or field kubb, then the field kubbs are raised at the location where they rest, and baseline kubbs are raised at their original location.\nPlay then changes hands, and Team B throws the batons at Team A's kubbs, but must first knock down any standing field kubbs.  If a baseline kubb is knocked down before all remaining field kubbs, the baseline kubb is returned to its upright position.  (Field kubbs that right themselves due to the momentum of the impact are considered knocked down.  Also kubbs are considered knocked down if they end up tilting and relying on a game piece for support.)  Again, all kubbs that are knocked down are thrown back over onto the opposite half of the field and then stood.\nIf either team does not knock down all field kubbs before their turn is over, the kubb closest to the centerline now represents the opposite team's baseline, and throwers may step up to that line to throw at their opponent's kubbs.  This rule applies only to throwing the batons at the opposite team's field and baseline kubbs; fallen kubbs are thrown from the original baseline, as are attempts to knock over the king.\nPlay continues in this fashion until a team is able to knock down all kubbs on one side, from both the field and the baseline.  If that team still has batons left to throw, they now attempt to knock over the king. If a thrower successfully topples the king, his team has won the game.\nIf at any time during the game the king is knocked down by a baton or kubb, the throwing team immediately loses the game.\nIn tournaments, winners are typically determined by playing best out of three.\nFor informal play between players of widely differing abilities, such as an adult and a child, it is permissible to shorten the length of the pitch. Another option is for both players to play on the same team and keep switching sides during play.\n\nTournaments\nThe Kubb World Championship[7] is held annually on the island of Gotland, Sweden. The U.S. Championship is held annually in Eau Claire, WI. \nTournaments in the U.S. have exploded since 2007, especially in the Midwest. In 2016, the U.S. tournament list includes over 40 tournaments. The majority of tournaments are located in Minnesota and Wisconsin. \nIn 2013, the U.S. Midwest Championship was re-introduced. The annual tournament travels throughout the Midwest.\n(2013: Rockford, IL; 2014: Decorah, IA; 2015: Madison, WI; 2016: Madison, WI; 2017: Shakopee, MN; 2018: Canton, OH)\nEuropean tournaments are held in Sweden, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, the Netherlands, Czech Republic, the U.K. and Italy. Most countries have their own national championship tournament.\n\nExternal links\n\n"}
