    "content": "Bodyboarding\n\nBodyboarding is a water sport in which the surfer rides a bodyboard on the crest, face, and curl of a wave which is carrying the surfer towards the shore. Bodyboarding is also referred to as Boogieboarding due to the invention of the \"Boogie Board\" by Tom Morey. The average bodyboard consists of a short, rectangular piece of hydrodynamic foam. Bodyboarders typically use swim fins for additional propulsion and control while riding a breaking wave.\n\nOrigin\nBodyboarding originates from an ancient form of riding waves (surfing) on one's belly. Indigenous Polynesians rode \"alaia\" (pronounced ah-lie-ah) boards either on their belly, knees, or feet (in rare instances). Alaia boards were generally made from the wood of Acacia koa and varied in length and shape.[1] They are distinct from the modern stand-up surfboards in that they had no ventral fins.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"last \": \"Brisick\", \"first \": \"Jamie\", \"title \": \"Ancient Surfboard Style Is Finding New Devotees\", \"newspaper \": \"[[The New York Times]]\", \"location \": \"New York City\", \"date \": \"4 December 2009\", \"url \": \"http://travel.nytimes.com/2009/12/04/travel/escapes/04alaia.html\"} Captain Cook recorded seeing Hawaiian villagers riding such boards when he came to Hawaii in 1778.\nThe boards he witnessed were about 90 to 180\u00a0cm (3 to 6\u00a0ft) and were ridden prone (on the belly) or on the knees. Alaia boards then evolved into the more modern \"paipo\" (pronounced pipe-oh) board. Paipo boards were either made of wood or fiberglass. Fiberglass boards usually had fins on the bottom.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://mypaipoboards.org/\", \"title\": \"My Paipo Boards and... More (for those of us who are prone to ride)\", \"accessdate\": \"11 July 2009\"} Tom Morey hybridized this form of riding waves on one's belly on a paipo to his craft of shaping stand-up surfboards.\n\nRiding forms\nBodyboards are shaped to the rider's specific needs and preferences such as height, weight, and form of riding. Three basic forms of riding a bodyboard include prone, dropknee, and stand-up.\n\nProne\nRiding prone refers to when one rides the wave on their stomach.[citation needed] When the bodyboarder goes left, they place their left hand on the upper left corner of the nose and place their right arm halfway down the rail of the right side of the board.[citation needed] The opposite is true of when the bodyboarder goes right.\n\nDropknee\nDropknee is when one places their preferred fin forward on the front of the deck with the opposing knee on the bottom end of the board with their fin dragging in the water. Dropknee was first pioneered in the late 1970s by Hawaii's Jack \"The Ripper\" Lindholm. Hence the term \"Jack Stance\" is in reference to his contribution to this form of riding. During the '80s and early '90s DK bodyboarding was gaining mass popularity. With riders such as Paul Roach,{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://bodyboardmuseum.com.au/tag/paul-roach/\", \"title\": \"Paul Roach - Bodyboard Museum\"} Kainoa McGee,{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://bodyboardmuseum.com.au/tag/kainoa-mcgee/\", \"title\": \"Kainoa McGee - Bodyboard Museum\"} and Keith Sasaki{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://bodyboardmuseum.com.au/tag/keith-sasaki/\", \"title\": \"Keith Sasaki - Bodyboard Museum\"} pushing the limits of what could be done on a bodyboard it was no wonder the groms of the day started copying.\nHolding a line on a wave in dropknee position is an art in itself, unlike fiberglass stand-up surfboards, the bodyboards dropknee riders use don't have fins underneath to help maintain a line on the face of a wave or to stop them sliding out, dropknee riders rely on weight transition from rail to rail to hold a line on a wave and turn/snap.\nThe bonus of not having fins underneath the board is being able to 360 spin (forward and reverse). It's a very technical move that looks incredible when performed in the pocket of the wave. It is also used during competitions to link up maneuvers for a higher score, (cutback to reverse 360, forward or backhand 360 to barrel or off the lip 360 to impress judges).\n\nStand-up\nStand-up consists of standing upright on the board and performing tricks on the face as well as in the air. While it isn't quite as popular as the other two forms of riding a bodyboard, three notable figures that popularized it are Danny Kim, Cavin Yap, and Chris Won Taloa.\n\nMaterials\nThe bodyboard differs from a surfboard in that it is much shorter (typically 100 to 110\u00a0cm (39 to 43\u00a0in) in length) and made out of different types of foam. The modern board consists of a foam 'core' encapsulated by a plastic bottom, a softer foam top known as the deck, and softer foam sides known as the rails. The core is made of dow/polyethylene, arcel, polystyrene, or Polypro/polypropylene. The bottom is made of Surlyn, HDPE or Bixby. The deck is made of 8LB or CrossLink. Each type of foam core, deck, or bottom material gives a bodyboard a different amount of flex and control. Speed from the bottom turn is increased when a bodyboarder bottom turns and the board flexes and recoils, releasing energy. If the board flexes too little or too easily, speed is lost. Dow (polyethylene) cores are best suited to cooler waters as they can be too flexible in warm water. Arcel and Polypro (polypropylene) cores are best suited for warmer waters due to their increased overall stiffness.\nMost boards on the market today contain one, two, or three rods (usually of carbon or graphite), referred to as stringers, to strengthen the board, reduce deformation, add stiffness and recoil to the core, thus providing greater speed off bottom turns and transitions on the wave. If a single stringer is used, it is placed in the center of the board running parallel to the rails. If two are used, they are placed symmetrically about the y-axis. Triple stringers are a combination of the placement of both a single and double stringer.\n\nConstruction\nDeck, rails, and bottom are bonded via various hot air lamination techniques to the core. Previous to the lamination technique, shapers accomplished this by using glue.\n\nFeatures\nThe shape, or curve, of the board affects how it rides. If the wide point of the board is nearer to the nose, the board tends to be best suited to prone riding as the bodyboarder's weight rests further up on the board. Boards with more parallel rails or a narrow nose tend to be more ideal for drop-knee and stand-up riding as the rider's center of gravity tends to rest further back.\nMost modern boards are equipped with channels that increase surface area in the critical parts of the board which, in turn, allow it to have varying hold and control on the wave. Originally, skegs were installed to decrease slippage on a wave face. However, progressive bodyboarding has rendered use of such skegs obsolete due to the looseness required for maneuverability on a wave. For such reasons, skegs are rarely used today and, even then, almost exclusively by dropknee or stand-up bodyboarders.\nTail shapes influence the way that boards perform in the line-up. Crescent tails provide the greatest amount of hold in steep waves. Crescent tails are generally preferred by drop-knee riders because the shape interferes less. Crescent tails are also preferred by beginners, due to being able to perform well in varying conditions.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://beachgoer.com/blogs/news/bodyboard-buying-guide\", \"title\": \"The Beachgoer Bodyboard Buying Guide\", \"website\": \"Beachgoer\", \"language\": \"en\"} Bat tails provide looseness for rail to rail transitions. Prone riders tend to prefer bat tails more than dropknee riders.\n\nProgression\nFrom the conception of the modern bodyboard in 1971, bodyboarding has experienced spurts of rapid growth both as an industry and extreme sport.[citation needed] With its origins in America, over the past decade the industry has shifted from a primarily American to a global industry phenomena. The sport has grown into a worldwide industry with growing strongholds in Australia, South American countries like Peru and Chile, Japan, Canary Islands (Spain), South Africa, and so forth. The evolution of maneuvers and waves in which it is being done have rendered it one of the most extreme wave riding forms in the world.\nBodyboarders have been accredited with pioneering some of the world's heaviest, most renowned surf locations in the world: Teahupo'o, French Polynesia; Shark Island, Australia; El Fronton, Spain; Cyclops, Australia; Ours, Australia; Luna Park, Australia; etc. In addition, bodyboarders place strong emphasis on aerial maneuvers on bigger, heavier sections of waves. These include aerial 360s, ARS (Air Roll Spin), el rollos, inverts (tweaking the board with the momentum of the wave and then swinging it back), backflips, ATS (A\u00e9reo Thiago Schmitd) and variations/hybrids of these maneuvers are also performed. Notable accomplishments for prone aerial maneuvers include:\nEl Rollo: Originally completed simultaneously by Hawaii's Pat Caldwell at Sandy Beach & Hawaii's Mike Stewart at Kona breaks such as Kahalu'u Bay.\nReverse Rollo: Originally completed by Kauai's Kyle Maligro. \nInvert: Unknown.\nARS (Air Roll Spin): Originally completed by Australia's Michael Eppelstun. Argued that California's Jacob Reeve completed it at the same time.\nBackflip: Originally completed by Australia's Michael Eppelstun.\nDouble Rollo: Originally completed by Australia's Michael Eppelstun.\nAir forward 360\u00b0: Originally completed by Hawaii's Mike Stewart.\nAir reverse 360\u00b0: Originally completed by Hawaii's Mike Stewart.\nAir Hubb (Forward air to el rollo): Originally completed by Kauai's Jeff Hubbard.\nGainer Flip: Originally completed by Tahiti's David Tuarau. \nGORF (Invert to front flip forward): Originally completed by Nathan \"Nugget\" Purcell.\nInvert to Reverse 360\u00b0 \"Inverse\": Originally completed by Kauai's Jeff Hubbard.\nDevert (Invert to reverse el rollo): Originally completed by Kauai's David Phillips.\nAir reverse 720\u00b0: Originally completed by Hawaii's Jeff Hubbard.\nATS - A\u00e9reo Thiago Schmitd (Thiago Schmitd's Air): Originally completed by Brazil's Thiago Schmitd\n\nFemale bodyboarders\nPhylis Dameron was the first person, man or woman, to ride big Waimea Bay on a bodyboard in the late 1970s. During the early 1990s in Brazil, Mariana Nogueira, Glenda Koslowski, and Stephanie Petterson set standards that pushed women's bodyboarding to a world class level. Stephanie Petterson won the first official World Championship of Women's Bodyboarding{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.bodyboard.org/awbchamps.html\", \"title\": \"AWB World Championship of Women's Bodyboarding Results\", \"publisher\": \"Association of Women Bodyboarders\", \"accessdate\": \"4 January 2009\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20090204014839/http://www.bodyboard.org/awbchamps.html\", \"archivedate\": \"4 February 2009\"} at Pipeline in 1990. It was the first women's event ever held there and initiated the longest running women's wave sport event in the world. 2009 marked the event's 20th anniversary.\n\nWorld championships\nFrom 1982\u20131993, the winner of the International Morey Boogie Bodyboard Pro Championships at Pipeline, Hawaii was considered world champion. Since then a world tour has determined the sport's champion. The world tour is administered by the Association of Professional Bodyboarders World Tour, the governing tour determining bodyboarding's world champion.\nCurrent Men's APB World Tour champion is Jared Houston of South Africa.\nCurrent Women's APB World Champion is Alexandra Rinder of Canary Islands.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://apbtour.com/\", \"work\": \"Association of Professional Bodyboarders\"}\n",
