The geocacher signs the log with their established code name and dates it, in order to prove that they found the cache. After signing the log, the cache must be placed back exactly where the person found it.  Larger containers such as plastic storage containers (Tupperware or similar) or ammunition boxes can also contain items for trading, such as toys or trinkets, usually of more sentimental worth than financial.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"2011-01-21\", \"title\": \"geocaching\", \"url\": \"http://nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/geocaching/\", \"last\": \"Society\", \"first\": \"National Geographic\", \"newspaper\": \"[[National Geographic Society]]\"} Geocaching shares many aspects with benchmarking, trigpointing, orienteering, treasure-hunting, letterboxing, waymarking and Munzee.\n\nHistory\n\nGeocaching was originally similar to the 160-year-old game letterboxing, which uses clues and references to landmarks embedded in stories. Geocaching was conceived shortly after the removal of Selective Availability from the Global Positioning System on May 2, 2000, because the improved accuracy{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.gps.gov/systems/gps/performance/accuracy/\", \"title\": \"U.S Government: GPS accuracy\", \"date\": \"February 17, 2012\", \"publisher\": \"Gps.gov\"} of the system allowed for a small container to be specifically placed and located. The first documented placement of a GPS-located cache took place on May 3, 2000, by Dave Ulmer of Beavercreek, Oregon.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.geocaching.com/about/history.aspx\", \"title\": \"The History of Geocaching\", \"website\": \"Geocaching.com\", \"publisher\": \"Groundspeak\"} The location was posted on the Usenet newsgroup sci.geo.satellite-nav{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"May 3, 2000\", \"title\": \"GPS Stash Hunt...

Only one geocache has ever been extraterrestrial: GC1BE91, which was on the International Space Station between 2008 as 2017.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?wp=gc1be91\", \"title\": \"GC1BE91 International Space Station\", \"website\": \"Geocaching.com\"} It used the launch area Baikonur in Kazakhstan as its position.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.geocaching.com/map/#?ll=45.95357,63.34176&z=14\", \"title\": \"Geocaching map\", \"publisher\": \"geocaching.com\"}\nThe activity was originally referred to as the GPS stash hunt or gpsstashing. This was changed shortly after the original hide when it was suggested in the gpsstash eGroup that \"stash\" could have negative connotations and the term geocaching was adopted.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/gpsstash/message/62\", \"title\": \"Cache vs Stash\", \"last\": \"Stum\", \"first\": \"Matt\", \"date\": \"May 30, 2000\", \"publisher\": \"[[Yahoo!]]\"}\nOver time, a variety of different hide-and-seek-type activities have been created or abandoned, so that \"geocaching\" may now refer to hiding and seeking containers, or locations or information without containers.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234769555_Hide_And_Seek_GPS_And_Geocaching_In_The_Classroom\", \"title\": \"Hide And Seek GPS And Geocaching In The Classroom {{!}} Download Citation\", \"website\": \"ResearchGate\", \"language\": \"en\"}\nAn independent accounting of the early history documents several controversial actions taken by Irish and Grounded, Inc., a predecessor to Groundspeak, to increase \"commercialization and monopolistic control over the hobby\".[14] More recently, other similar hobbies such as Munzee have attracted some geocachers by rapidly adopting smart-phone technology, which has caused \"some resistance from geocaching organizers about placing caches along with Munzees\".{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"title\": \"New game in town, Nerds gain more revenge with Munzee\", \"url\": \"http://www.telegram.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20121110/NEWS/111109916/1246\", \"accessdate\": \"January 20, 2013\", \"last\": \"Spencer\", \"first\": \"Susan\", \"newspaper\": \"TELEGRAM & GAZETTE\"}\n\nGeocaches\nFor the traditional geocache, a geocacher will place a waterproof container containing a log book (with pen and/or pencil) and trade items or trackables, then record the cache's coordinates. These coordinates, along with other details of the location, are posted on a listing site (see list of some sites below). Other geocachers obtain the coordinates from that listing site and seek out the cache using their handheld GPS receivers. The finding geocachers record their exploits in the logbook and online, but then must return the cache to the same coordinates so that other geocachers may find it. Geocachers are free to take objects (except the logbook, pencil, or stamp) from the cache in exchange for leaving something of similar or higher value.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.countryfile.com/explore-countryside/beginners-guide-geocaching\", \"title\": \"The beginners' guide to geocaching\", \"date\": \"2015-02-12\", \"publisher\": \"Countryfile Magazine\"}\n\nTypical cache \"treasures\", also known in the geocaching world as swag,{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.geocaching.com/about/glossary.aspx\", \"title\": \"Glossary of Terms\", \"website\": \"Geocaching.com\", \"publisher\": \"Groundspeak, Inc.\"} are not high in monetary value but may hold personal value to the finder.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.countryfile.com/explore-countryside/beginners-guide-geocaching\", \"title\": \"The beginners' guide to geocaching\", \"date\": \"2015-02-12\", \"publisher\": \"Countryfile Magazine\"} Aside from the logbook, common cache contents are unusual coins or currency, small toys, ornamental buttons, CDs, or books. Although not required, many geocachers decide to leave behind signature items, such as personal Geocoins, pins, or craft items, to mark their presence at the cache location.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.geocaching.com/about/glossary.aspx\", \"title\": \"Glossary of Terms\", \"website\": \"Geocaching.com\", \"publisher\": \"Groundspeak, Inc.\"} Disposable cameras are popular as they allow for anyone who found the cache to take a picture which can be developed and uploaded to a Geocaching web site listed below.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"last1\": \"Sherman\", \"first1\": \"Erik\", \"date\": \"2004\", \"title\": \"Geocaching hike and seek with your gps\", \"location\": \"Berkeley\", \"publisher\": \"APRESS\", \"page\": \"19\", \"isbn\": \"1-59059-122-4\"} Also common are objects that are moved from cache to cache called \"hitchhikers\", such as Travel Bugs or Geocoins, whose travels may be logged and followed online.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"title\": \"Pokemon who? Richmond geocachers are the real life scavenger hunters\", \"url\": \"http://www.richmond-news.com/news/weekly-feature/pokemon-who-richmond-geocachers-are-the-real-life-scavenger-hunters-1.2326716\", \"last\": \"News\", \"first\": \"Hedy Ng/Special to the\", \"newspaper\": \"Richmond News\"} Cachers who initially place a Travel Bug or Geocoins often assign specific goals for their trackable items. Examples of goals are to be placed in a certain cache a long distance from home, or to travel to a certain country, or to travel faster and farther than other hitchhikers in a race. Less common trends are site-specific information pages about the historic significance of the site, types of trees, birds in the area or other such information. Higher-value items are occasionally included in geocaches as a reward for the First to Find (called \"FTF\"), or in locations which are harder to reach.  Dangerous or illegal items, weapons, food and drugs are not allowed and are specifically against the rules of most geocache listing sites.\nIf a geocache has been vandalized or stolen, it is said to have been \"muggled\". The former term plays off the fact that those not familiar with geocaching are called muggles, a term borrowed from the Harry Potter series of books which was rising in popularity at the same time geocaching got its start.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.geocaching.com/about/glossary.aspx\", \"title\": \"Glossary of Terms\", \"website\": \"Geocaching.com\", \"publisher\": \"Groundspeak, Inc.\"}\n\nVariations\nTraditional geocaching gave birth to GeoCaching \u2013 an active urban game of the Encounter project. The game is quite similar to geocaching but has time limitations and hints.\nGeocaches vary in size, difficulty, and location. Simple caches that are placed near a roadside are often called \"drive-bys\", \"park 'n grabs\" (PNGs), or \"cache and dash\". Geocaches may also be complex, involving lengthy searches, significant travel, or use of specialist equipment such as SCUBA diving, kayaking, or abseiling.  Different geocaching websites list different variations per their own policies.\nContainer sizes range from \"nanos\", particularly magnetic nanos, which can be smaller than the tip of a finger and have only enough room to store the log sheet, to 20-liter (5 gallon) buckets or even larger containers, such as entire trucks.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.geocaching.com/blog/2015/06/gigantesque-the-big-one-gc5q8n-geocache-of-the-week/\", \"title\": \"gigantesque \\u2013 The Big One (GC5Q8N) \\u2013 Geocache of the Week\", \"last\": \"H\", \"first\": \"Derek\", \"date\": \"June 25, 2015\"} The most common cache containers in rural areas are lunch-box-sized plastic storage containers or surplus military ammunition cans. Ammo cans are considered the gold standard of containers because they are very sturdy, waterproof, animal- and fire-resistant, and relatively cheap, and have plenty of room for trade items. Smaller containers are more common in urban areas because they can be more easily hidden.\n\nGeocache types\nOver time many variations of geocaches have developed. Different platforms often have their own rules on which types are allowed or how they are classified. The following cache types are supported by both geocaching.com and opencaching.us unless stated otherwise.\nA Traditional cache is the most common type and consists of a container with a logbook. Exact coordinates where the cache is located are given.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.geocaching.com/about/cache_types.aspx\", \"title\": \"Geocache types\", \"website\": \"geocaching.com\", \"publisher\": \"Groundspeak\"}{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://wiki.opencaching.us/index.php/Cache_parameters\", \"title\": \"Cache Parameters\", \"website\": \"wiki.opencaching.us\", \"publisher\": \"Opencaching Network\"}\nA Multi-cache consists of one or more stages, each of them containing the coordinates for the next one; the final stage contains a physical container with the logbook.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.geocaching.com/about/cache_types.aspx\", \"title\": \"Geocache types\", \"website\": \"geocaching.com\", \"publisher\": \"Groundspeak\"}{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://wiki.opencaching.us/index.php/Cache_parameters\", \"title\": \"Cache Parameters\", \"website\": \"wiki.opencaching.us\", \"publisher\": \"Opencaching Network\"} An Offset cache is a multi-cache in which the initial coordinates are for a location containing information that encodes the final cache coordinates. An example would be to direct the finder to a plaque where the digits of a date on the plaque correspond to coordinates of the final cache.\nMystery/puzzle caches require one to discover information or solve a puzzle to find the cache. Some mystery caches provide a puzzle that must be solved to determine the physical cache location. Caches which do not fit into other categories are classified as mystery caches.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.geocaching.com/about/cache_types.aspx\", \"title\": \"Geocache types\", \"website\": \"geocaching.com\", \"publisher\": \"Groundspeak\"}\nChallenge caches require a geocacher to complete a reasonably attainable geocaching-related task before being able to log the find. Examples include finding a number of caches that meet a category, completing a number of cache finds within a period of time, or finding a cache for every calendar day. On geocaching.com it is considered a subtype of the Mystery cache, while it is a type on its own on opencaching.us.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://wiki.opencaching.us/index.php/Cache_parameters\", \"title\": \"Cache Parameters\", \"website\": \"wiki.opencaching.us\", \"publisher\": \"Opencaching Network\"}{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.geocaching.com/help/index.php?pg=kb.chapter&id=127&pgid=206\", \"title\": \"Challenge caches\", \"website\": \"geocaching.com\", \"publisher\": \"Groundspeak\"}\nA Night cache is multi-stage and intended to be found at night by following a series of reflectors with a flashlight to the final cache location. Considered a variant of the Mystery cache on geoocaching.com.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.geocaching.com/help/index.php?pg=kb.chapter&id=127&pgid=69\", \"title\": \"Night and UV Caches\", \"publisher\": \"Groundspeak\"}\nA Chirp cache is a Garmin-created innovative advance on multi-caches using new wireless beacon technology. The Chirp stores hints, multicache coordinates, counts visitors and confirms the cache is nearby.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"2010\", \"title\": \"The Joy of Geocaching\", \"url\": \"https://archive.org/details/joyofgeocachingh0000gill\", \"location\": \"Fresno, California\", \"publisher\": \"Quill Driver Books\", \"urlaccess\": \"registration\", \"authors\": \"Paul Gillin and Dana Gillin\"}[26] These caches were fully supported at OpenCaching.com, but they caused considerable discussion and some controversy at Groundspeak, where they were given a new \"attribute\".{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.geocaching.com/about/cache_types.aspx\", \"title\": \"Geocache types\", \"website\": \"geocaching.com\", \"publisher\": \"Groundspeak\"}[27]\nA Wherigo cache is a multi-stage cache hunt that uses a Wherigo \"cartridge\" to guide the player to find a physical cache sometime during cartridge play, usually at the end. Not all Wherigo cartridges incorporate geocaches into game play. Wherigo caches are unique to the geocaching.com website.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.geocaching.com/about/cache_types.aspx\", \"title\": \"Geocache types\", \"website\": \"geocaching.com\", \"publisher\": \"Groundspeak\"} Wherigo is a GPS location-aware software platform  initially released in January 2008. Authors can develop self-enclosed story files (called \"cartridges\") that are read by the Wherigo player software, installed on either a GPS unit or smartphone. The player and story take advantage of the location information provided by the GPS to trigger in-game events, such as using a virtual object or interacting with characters. Completing an adventure can require reaching different locations and solving puzzles. Cartridges are coded in Lua.  Lua may be used directly, but a builder application is usually used. The Wherigo site{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.wherigo.com/about.aspx\", \"title\": \"Wherigo > About the Wherigo Platform\", \"publisher\": \"[[Groundspeak]]\", \"work\": \"Wherigo.com\"} offers a builder application and a database of adventures free for download, though the builder has remained in its Alpha version since its last release in May 2008.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.wherigo.com/builder/default.aspx\", \"title\": \"Wherigo Builder\", \"publisher\": \"[[Groundspeak]]\", \"work\": \"Wherigo.com\"}  The official player is only available for Pocket PC.  A built-in player is available on Garmin Colorado and Oregon GPS models. The Wherigo Foundation{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://wherigofoundation.com/foundation/\", \"title\": \"Wherigo Foundation\", \"publisher\": \"WherigoFoundation\", \"work\": \"WherigoFoundation.com\"} was organized in December 2012.  The group is composed of all Wherigo application developers who, up until that time, had been acting and developing separately.  Their goal is to provide a consistent Wherigo experience across platforms, connect Wherigo applications via an API, and add modern features to the Wherigo platform.  While Groundspeak is aware of this project, the company has yet to take a position.\nA Letterbox cache or a Letterbox hybrid cache is a combination of a geocache and a letterbox in the same container. A letterbox has a rubber stamp and a logbook instead of tradable items. Letterboxers carry their own stamp with them, to stamp the letterbox's log book and inversely stamp their personal log book with the letterbox stamp. The hybrid cache contains the important materials for this and may or may not include trade items.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.geocaching.com/about/cache_types.aspx\", \"title\": \"Geocache types\", \"website\": \"geocaching.com\", \"publisher\": \"Groundspeak\"}{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://wiki.opencaching.us/index.php/Cache_parameters\", \"title\": \"Cache Parameters\", \"website\": \"wiki.opencaching.us\", \"publisher\": \"Opencaching Network\"}\nMoving/travelling caches are found at a listed set of coordinates. The finder hides the cache in a different location, and updates the listing, essentially becomes the hider, and the next finder continues the cycle. This cache type is supported at opencaching.us while it has been discontinued at geocaching.com.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://wiki.opencaching.us/index.php/Cache_parameters\", \"title\": \"Cache Parameters\", \"website\": \"wiki.opencaching.us\", \"publisher\": \"Opencaching Network\"}{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.geocaching.com/help/index.php?pg=kb.chapter&id=127&pgid=890\", \"title\": \"The history of traveling caches\", \"website\": \"geocaching.com\", \"accessdate\": \"2019-09-08\"}\nGuest Book caches use guest books often found in museums, tourist information centers, etc. They are listed exclusively at opencaching.us.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://wiki.opencaching.us/index.php/Cache_parameters\", \"title\": \"Cache Parameters\", \"website\": \"wiki.opencaching.us\", \"publisher\": \"Opencaching Network\"}\nThe following cache types don't contain a physical logbook.\nA BIT cache is a laminated card with a QR code, similar to Munzee. The BIT Cache also contains a URL and a password, for logging purposes. They are listed exclusively on opencaching.us.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://wiki.opencaching.us/index.php/Cache_parameters\", \"title\": \"Cache Parameters\", \"website\": \"wiki.opencaching.us\", \"publisher\": \"Opencaching Network\"}{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.opencaching.us/\", \"title\": \"opencaching.us\", \"publisher\": \"opencaching.us\", \"author\": \"OPENCACHING Geocaching in North America\"}[33]\nVirtual caches are coordinates for a location, which has some other described object. Validation for finding a virtual cache generally requires one to email the cache hider with information such as a date or a name on a plaque, or to post a picture of oneself at the site with GPS receiver in hand.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.geocaching.com/about/cache_types.aspx\", \"title\": \"Geocache types\", \"website\": \"geocaching.com\", \"publisher\": \"Groundspeak\"} New virtual caches are no longer allowed by Groundspeak,[34] but they remain supported by other sites.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://wiki.opencaching.us/index.php/Cache_parameters\", \"title\": \"Cache Parameters\", \"website\": \"wiki.opencaching.us\", \"publisher\": \"Opencaching Network\"} The Groundspeak website no longer lists new caches without a physical container, including virtual and webcam caches; however, older caches of these types have been grandfathered in (except for locationless/reverse, which are completely archived). On August 24, 2017, Groundspeak announced \"Virtual Rewards\", allowing 4000 new virtual caches to be placed during the following year.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.geocaching.com/blog/2017/08/virtual-rewards/\", \"title\": \"Virtual Rewards\", \"publisher\": \"geocaching.com\"} Earthcaches are one of the two exceptions to the no-container rule; they are caches in which players must answer geological questions to complete the cache. The other exception is for event caches; for an event to qualify, it must be specifically or mainly for geocachers, and must have a minimum duration dependent upon its category (CITO, regular, Mega, or Giga).{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://support.groundspeak.com/index.php?pg=kb.chapter&id=23\", \"title\": \"Calendars and Events (regular, mega, CITO)\", \"publisher\": \"Groundspeak.com\"} Attendees of event caches can log that they 'attended', which will increment their number of found caches. Groundspeak created a waymarking website to handle all other non-physical caches.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://support.groundspeak.com/index.php?pg=kb.page&id=401\", \"title\": \"Virtual Geocaches\", \"publisher\": \"Groundspeak.com\"}\nEarthcaches are virtual caches that are organized by the Geological Society of America. The cacher usually has to perform a task which teaches an educational lesson about the earth science of the cache area. They are listed at geocaching.com.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.geocaching.com/about/cache_types.aspx\", \"title\": \"Geocache types\", \"website\": \"geocaching.com\", \"publisher\": \"Groundspeak\"}\nLocationless/reverse caches are similar to a scavenger hunt. A description is given for something to find, such as a one-room schoolhouse, and the finder locates an example of this object. The finder records the location using their GPS receiver and often takes a picture at the location showing the named object and his or her GPS receiver. Typically others are not allowed to log that same location as a find.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.geocaching.com/about/cache_types.aspx\", \"title\": \"Geocache types\", \"website\": \"geocaching.com\", \"publisher\": \"Groundspeak\"}\nWebcam caches are virtual caches whose coordinates have a public webcam.

Players are often encouraged to take pictures at the dashpoints and upload them to the site.\n\nStratocaching\nGeocaching from space is a combination of flight to near space, the geocaching game, and a unique science experiment. The first Stratocaching event was held on 16 November 2013 in Prague and was successful. Ten caches and two \"radioseeds\" went up to 30\u00a0km (19\u00a0mi) into the stratosphere on a gondola called Dropion module carried by a high-altitude balloon. The caches and seeds then fell to earth for people to find.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://technet.idnes.cz/first-stratocaching-2013-prague-czech-republic-geocaching-near-space-game-13m-/tec_vesmir.aspx?c=A131118_172217_tec_vesmir_pka\", \"title\": \"VIDEO: First Stratocaching attracted 200k Czechs with a near-space treasure hunt\", \"date\": \"November 18, 2013\", \"author\": \"Pavel Kas\\u00edk\"}[47]{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://technet.idnes.cz/stratocaching-geocaching-from-space-experiment-prague-czech-republic-1kk-/tec_vesmir.aspx?c=A131115_171153_tec_vesmir_pka\", \"title\": \"New GPS game is out of this world: Czechs are introducing Stratocaching\", \"date\": \"November 15, 2013\", \"author\": \"Pavel Kas\\u00edk\"}\n\nObtaining data\nGPX files containing information such as a cache description and information about recent visitors to the cache are available from various listing sites. Geocachers may upload geocache data (also known as waypoints) from various websites in various formats, most commonly in file-type GPX, which uses XML.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.topografix.com/gpx.asp\", \"title\": \"GPX: The GPS Exchange Format\"} Some websites allow geocachers to search (build queries) for multiple caches within a geographic area based on criteria such as ZIP code or coordinates, downloading the results as an email attachment on a schedule. In recent years, Android and iPhone users have been able to download apps such as GeoBeagle{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://code.google.com/p/geobeagle/\", \"title\": \"GeoBeagle: an Android app for geocaching and letterboxing\", \"last\": \"geobeagleteam\", \"publisher\": \"Google Project Hosting\", \"work\": \"Google codes projects\"} that allow them to use their 3G and GPS-enabled devices to actively search for and download new caches.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"title\": \"GeoBeagle \\u2013 Geocaching Apps f\\u00fcr Android Smartphones (5) (GeoBeagle - Geocaching apps for Android smartphones (5))\", \"url\": \"http://www.navigation-professionell.de/geobeagle-geocaching-apps-fur-android-smartphones-5/\", \"accessdate\": \"January 22, 2013\", \"last\": \"Bardua\", \"first\": \"Joachim\", \"newspaper\": \"Navigation-Professionell\"}{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"title\": \"Augmented reality meets scavenger hunt with GeoBeagle, Wikitude\", \"url\": \"https://venturebeat.com/2009/08/09/augmented-reality-meets-scavenger-hunt-with-geobeagle-wikitude/\", \"accessdate\": \"January 22, 2013\", \"last\": \"Cutler\", \"first\": \"Kim-Mai\", \"newspaper\": \"Venturebeat\"}\n\nConverting and filtering data\nA variety of geocaching applications are available for geocache data management, file-type translation, and personalization. Geocaching software can assign special icons or search (filter) for caches based on certain criteria (e.g. distance from an assigned point, difficulty, date last found).\nPaperless geocaching means hunting a geocache without a physical printout of the cache description. Traditionally, this means that the seeker has an electronic means of viewing the cache information in the field, such as pre-downloading the information to a PDA or other electronic device. Various applications are able to directly upload and read GPX files without further conversion. Newer GPS devices released by Garmin, DeLorme and Magellan have the ability to read GPX files directly, thus eliminating the need for a PDA.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"April 1, 2008\", \"title\": \"Outdoor-Navigation mit dem Garmin Colorado 300\", \"url\": \"http://www.connect.de/themen_spezial/Outdoor-Navigation-mit-dem-Garmin-Colorado-300_1596951.html\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"language\": \"German\", \"publisher\": \"connect.de\", \"page\": \"1\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20081220202659/http://www.connect.de/themen_spezial/Outdoor-Navigation-mit-dem-Garmin-Colorado-300_1596951.html\", \"archivedate\": \"December 20, 2008\", \"accessdate\": \"November 25, 2008\"} Other methods include viewing real-time information on a portable computer with internet access or with an Internet-enabled smart phone. The latest advancement of this practice involves installing dedicated applications on a smart phone with a built-in GPS receiver. Seekers can search for and download caches in their immediate vicinity directly to the application and use the on-board GPS receiver to find the cache.\nA more controversial version of paperless caching involves mass-downloading only the coordinates and cache names (or waypoint IDs) for hundreds of caches into older receivers. This is a common practice of some cachers and has been used successfully for years. In many cases, however, the cache description and hint are never read by the seeker before hunting the cache. This means they are unaware of potential restrictions such as limited hunt times, park open/close times, off-limit areas, and suggested parking locations.\n\nMobile devices\nThe website geocaching.com{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.geocaching.com/\", \"title\": \"geocaching.com\", \"publisher\": \"geocaching.com\", \"author\": \"${l.c}\"} now sells mobile applications which allow users to view caches through a variety of different devices. Currently, the Android, iPhone, and Windows Phone mobile platforms have applications in their respective stores. The apps also allow for a trial version with limited functionality.

would instead require federal, state or local funds to accomplish. Geocachers are also encouraged to clean up after themselves by retrieving old containers once a cache has been removed from play.\nGeocaching is legal in every country except North Korea (where GPS and all other mobile devices are illegal to possess){\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"2012-02-17\", \"title\": \"Geocaching Steps into North Korea\", \"url\": \"https://www.geocaching.com/blog/2012/02/geocaching-steps-into-north-korea/\", \"newspaper\": \"The Geocaching Blog\"} and is usually positively received when explained to law enforcement officials.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"2013-09-04\", \"title\": \"Advice to Geocache Hiders from Law Enforcement\", \"url\": \"https://www.geocaching.com/blog/2013/09/advice-to-geocache-hiders-from-law-enforcement/\", \"newspaper\": \"The Geocaching Blog\"} However, certain types of placements can be problematic. Although generally disallowed, hiders could place caches on private property without adequate permission (intentionally or otherwise), which encourages cache finders to trespass. Caches might also be hidden in places where the act of searching can make a finder look suspicious (e.g. near schools, children's playgrounds, banks, courthouses, or in residential neighborhoods), or where the container placement could be mistaken for a drug stash or a bomb (especially in urban settings, under bridges,{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"June 3, 2011\", \"title\": \"Police Search For Gamer Who Hung Geocache From Railroad Overpass\", \"url\": \"http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2011/06/03/police-search-for-gamer-who-hung-geocache-from-railroad-overpass/\", \"newspaper\": \"The Naperville Sun and CBS Chicago\"} near banks, courthouses, or embassies). As a result, geocachers are strongly advised to label their geocaches where possible, so that they are not mistaken for a harmful object if discovered by non-geocachers.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"title \": \"Detonated 'bomb' turns out to be box of toys\", \"work \": \"The Deseret News\", \"date \": \"November 12, 2005\", \"url \": \"http://www.deseretnews.com/article/635160668/Detonated-bomb-turns-out-to-be-box-of-toys.html\"}{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.gagb.org.uk/cache-labels.php\", \"title\": \"GAGB Geocache labels\", \"publisher\": \"Geocaching Association of Great Britain\"}\nAs well as concerns about littering and bomb threats, some geocachers hide their caches in inappropriate locations, such as electrical boxes, that may encourage risky behaviour, especially amongst children.

However, as cache reviewers typically cannot see exactly where and how every particular cache is hidden, problematic hides can slip through. Ultimately it is also up to cache finders to use discretion when attempting to search for a cache, and report any problems.\n\nLaws and legislation\nRegional rules for placement of caches have become quite complex. For example, in Virginia,[84] the Virginia Department of Transportation and the Wildlife Management Agency now forbids the placement of geocaches on all land controlled by those agencies. Some cities, towns and recreation areas allow geocaches with few or no restrictions, but others require compliance with lengthy permitting procedures.\nThe South Carolina House of Representatives passed Bill 3777[85] in 2005, stating, \"It is unlawful for a person to engage in the activity of geocaching or letterboxing in a cemetery or in an historic or archeological site or property publicly identified by an historical marker without the express written consent of the owner or entity which oversees that cemetery site or property.\" The bill was referred to committee on first reading in the Senate and has been there ever since.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"May 20, 2005\", \"title\": \"High\\u2013tech scavenger hunt Geocachers invade hallowed ground\", \"url\": \"http://www.thecolumbiastar.com/news/2005-05-20/Front_Page/001.html\", \"publisher\": \"Columbia Star\", \"last\": \"Haynie\", \"first\": \"Rachel\"}\nThe Illinois Department of Natural Resources requires geocachers who wish to place a geocache at any Illinois state park to submit the location on a USGS 7.5 minute topographical map, the name and contact information of the person(s) wishing to place the geocache, a list of the original items to be included in the geocache, and a picture of the container that is to be placed.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.dnr.illinois.gov/recreation/pages/geocaching.aspx\", \"title\": \"Recreation\", \"website\": \"www.dnr.illinois.gov\"}\n\nNotable incidents\nSeveral deaths have occurred while geocaching.[88][89][90] [91]\nThe death of a 21-year-old experienced cacher, in December 2011, \"while attempting a Groundspeak cache that does not look all that dangerous,\" led to discussion in Groundspeak forums of whether changes should be made, and whether cache owners or Groundspeak could be held liable.[92] Groundspeak have since updated their geocaching.com Terms of Use Agreement which specifies that geocachers find geocaches at their own risk.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.geocaching.com/account/documents/termsofuse\", \"title\": \"TERMS OF USE AGREEMENT 2A.

Six days later a second body, that of a man in the group, was found in the river.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.radio.cz/en/section/news/second-body-found-in-vltava-river-that-of-missing-geocacher\", \"title\": \"Second body found in Vltava River that of missing geocacher {{!}} Radio Prague\", \"website\": \"Radio Praha\", \"language\": \"en\", \"accessdate\": \"1 April 2019\", \"last1\": \"Kenety\", \"first1\": \"Brian\"} Two exhausted drowning people were rescued from the river suffering mostly from numerous bruises and blunt traumas.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/povoden-v-prazskem-podzemi-jak-se-ctverice-lidi-sama-dostala-do-smrtelneho-nebezpeci-49004?dop-ab-variant=&seq-no=1&source=hp\", \"title\": \"Povode\\u0148 v pra\\u017esk\\u00e9m podzem\\u00ed: Jak se \\u010dtve\\u0159ice lid\\u00ed sama dostala do smrteln\\u00e9ho nebezpe\\u010d\\u00ed - Seznam Zpr\\u00e1vy\", \"website\": \"www.seznamzpravy.cz\"}{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://zpravy.idnes.cz/potok-praha-nabrezi-kanaly-patrani-osoba-policie-hasici-geochaching-1py-/domaci.aspx?c=A180609_193521_domaci_pmk\", \"title\": \"Policie obnovila p\\u00e1tr\\u00e1n\\u00ed po lovci poklad\\u016f, potvrdila identitu utonul\\u00e9 \\u017eeny\", \"date\": \"2018-06-09\", \"website\": \"iDNES.cz\"}\n\nWebsites and data ownership\nNumerous websites list geocaches around the world. Geocaching websites vary in many ways, including control of data.\n\nFirst page\nThe first website to list geocaches was announced by Mike Teague on May 8, 2000.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.funtrivia.com/en/subtopics/Geocaching---Early-History-295308.html\", \"title\": \"Geocaching - Early History - Fun Facts, Questions, Answers, Information\", \"accessdate\": \"2017-01-17\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20150713220930/http://www.funtrivia.com/en/subtopics/Geocaching---Early-History-295308.html\", \"archivedate\": \"July 13, 2015\"} On September 2, 2000, Jeremy Irish emailed the gpsstash mailing list that he had registered the domain name geocaching.com and had set up his own Web site. He copied the caches from Mike Teague's database into his own. On September 6, Mike Teague announced that Jeremy Irish was taking over cache listings. As of 2012[update], Teague had logged only 5 caches.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://awesomegeocaching.com/2012/08/14/interview-mike-teague-on-the-first-geocache-listing-site/\", \"title\": \"Interview: Mike Teague On The First Geocache Listing Site\", \"date\": \"August 14, 2012\", \"work\": \"Awesome Geocaching\"}\n\nGeocaching.com\nThe largest site is Geocaching.com, owned by Groundspeak Inc., which began operating in late 2000. With a worldwide membership and a freemium business model, the website claims millions of caches and members in over 200 countries. Hides and events are reviewed by volunteer regional cache reviewers before publication. Free membership allows users access to coordinates, descriptions, and logs for some caches; for a fee, users are allowed additional search tools, the ability to download large amounts of cache information onto their gps at once, instant email notifications about new caches, and access to premium-member-only caches.[103]\n\nOpencaching Network\nThe Opencaching Network provides independent, non-commercial listing sites based in the cacher's country or region. The Opencaching Network lists the most types of caches, including traditional, virtual, moving, multi, quiz, webcam, BIT, guest book, USB, event and MP3. The Opencaching Network is less restrictive than many sites, and does not charge for the use of the sites, the service being community driven. Some (or all) listings may or may not be required to be reviewed by community volunteers before being published and although cross-listing is permitted, it is discouraged. Some listings are listed on other sites, but there are many that are unique to the Opencaching Network. Features include the ability to organize one's favourite caches, build custom searches, be instantly notified of new caches in one's area, seek and create caches of all types, export GPX queries, statpics, etc. Each Opencaching Node provides the same API for free (called \"OKAPI\"{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://github.com/opencaching/okapi\", \"title\": \"Opencaching Network API\"}) for use by developers who want to create third-party applications able to use the Opencaching Network's content.\nCountries with associated opencaching websites include the United States at www.opencaching.us;{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.eastcountymagazine.org/joys-geocaching\", \"title\": \"THE JOYS OF GEOCACHING\", \"website\": \"East County Magazine\", \"language\": \"en\"} Germany at www.opencaching.de;{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"title\": \"Geocaching: Basiswissen f\\u00fcr Draussen\", \"publisher\": \"Conrad Stein Verlag, GmbH\", \"isbn\": \"3866862725\", \"last\": \"Gr\\u00fcndel\", \"first\": \"Markus\"}{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.ndr.de/ratgeber/reise/Wie-funktioniert-Geocaching,geocaching376.html\", \"title\": \"Geocaching: Wie funktioniert das?\", \"last\": \"NDR\", \"website\": \"www.ndr.de\", \"language\": \"de\"} Sweden at www.opencaching.se; Poland at www.opencaching.pl;{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.pcformat.pl/Geocaching---co-to-jest-i-na-czym-polega,a,4027\", \"title\": \"Geocaching - co to jest i na czym polega?\", \"website\": \"www.pcformat.pl\"} Czech Republic at www.opencaching.cz;{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&tl=en&u=https://navigovat.mobilmania.cz/clanky/garmin-spousti-opencaching-porazi-geocaching/sc-265-a-1315117\", \"title\": \"Google Translate\", \"website\": \"translate.google.com\"}{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://navigovat.mobilmania.cz/clanky/garmin-spousti-opencaching-porazi-geocaching/sc-265-a-1315117\", \"title\": \"Garmin spou\\u0161t\\u00ed OpenCaching: poraz\\u00ed Geocaching?\", \"last\": \"Kuruc\", \"first\": \"Ji\\u0159\\u00ed\", \"website\": \"Navigovat.MobilMania.cz\", \"language\": \"cs\"} The Netherlands at www.opencaching.nl; Romania at www.opencaching.ro; the United Kingdom at www.opencache.uk.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://wiki.opencaching.us/index.php/Main_Page\", \"title\": \"OpenCaching United States Wiki\"}{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://opensource.com/life/14/9/geocaching-experience-catching\", \"title\": \"The geocaching experience is catching\", \"last\": \"comments\", \"first\": \"30 Sep 2014 Heiko W. RuppFeed 167up 2\", \"website\": \"Opensource.com\", \"language\": \"en\"}\nThe main difference between opencaching and traditional listing sites is that all services are open to the users at no cost. Generally, most geocaching services or websites offer some basic information for free, but users may have to pay for premium membership that allows access to more information or advanced searching capabilities. This is not the case with opencaching; every geocache is listed and accessible to everyone for free.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://wiki.opencaching.us/index.php/Main_Page\", \"title\": \"OpenCaching United States Wiki\"}\nAdditionally, Opencaching sites allow users to rate and report on existing geocaches. This allows users to see what other cachers think of the cache and it encourages participants to place higher quality caches. The rating system also greatly reduces the problem of abandoned or unsatisfactory caches still being listed after repeated negative comments or posts in the cache logs.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://wiki.opencaching.us/index.php/Main_Page\", \"title\": \"OpenCaching United States Wiki\"}\n\nOpenCaching.com\nOpenCaching.com (short: OX) was a site created and run by Garmin from 2010\u20132015, which had the stated aim of being as free and open as possible with no paid content. Caches were approved by a community process and coordinates were available without an account. The service closed on 14 August 2015.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.eastcountymagazine.org/joys-geocaching\", \"title\": \"THE JOYS OF GEOCACHING\", \"website\": \"East County Magazine\", \"language\": \"en\"}{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://opensource.com/life/14/9/geocaching-experience-catching\", \"title\": \"The geocaching experience is catching\", \"last\": \"comments\", \"first\": \"30 Sep 2014 Heiko W.

Many of them also accept unique listings of caches for their site, but these listings tend to be less popular than the international sites, although occasionally the regional sites may have more caches than the international sites. There are some exceptions though, e.g. in the former Soviet Union, the site Geocaching.su remains popular because it accepts listings in the Cyrillic script. Additional international sites include Geocaching.de, a German website, and Geocaching Australia, which accepts listings of cache types deprecated by geocaching.com, cache types such as TrigPoint and Moveable caches, as well as traditional geocache types.\n\nGPSgames\nGPSgames.org is an online community dedicated to all kinds of games involving Global Positioning System receivers.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.gpsgames.org/content/blogsection/9/59/\", \"title\": \"About GPSgames.org\"} GPSgames.org allows traditional geocaches as well as virtual, locationless, and traveler geocaches. Geodashing, Shutterspot, GeoVexilla, MinuteWar, GeoPoker, and GeoGolf are among the GPS games available.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.gpsgames.org/content/section/3/57/\", \"title\": \"GPS Games\"} GPSgames.org has been 100% free since 2001, through donations.[120]\n\nNaviCache\nNavicache.com started as a regional listing service in 2001.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.notaboutthenumbers.com/2012/06/05/the-rebirth-of-navicaching/\", \"title\": \"The Rebirth Of Navicaching\"} While many of the website's listings have been posted to other sites, it also offers unique listings. The website lists nearly any type of geocache and does not charge to access any of the caches listed in its database. All submissions are reviewed and approved.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.navicache.com/cgi-bin/db/faq.google2.wap.pl\", \"title\": \"Navicache Geocaching FAQ\"} Navicache is under transition to new owners, who said they \"plan to develop a site that geocachers want, with rules that geocachers think are suitable. Geocaching.com and OX are both backed by large enterprises, and while that means they have more funding and people, we\u2019re a much smaller team \u2013 so our advantage is the ability to be dynamic and listen to the users.\"{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.notaboutthenumbers.com/2012/06/05/the-rebirth-of-navicaching/\", \"title\": \"The Rebirth Of Navicaching\"}\n\nTerraCaching\nTerracaching.com seeks to provide high-quality caches made so by the difficulty of the hide or from the quality of the location. Membership is managed through a sponsorship system, and each cache is under continual peer review from other members. Terracaching.com embraces virtual caches alongside traditional or multi-stage caches and includes many locationless caches among the thousands of caches in its database. It is increasingly attracting members who like the point system. In Europe, TerraCaching is supported by Terracaching.eu. This site is translated in different European languages, has an extended FAQ and extra supporting tools for TerraCaching. TerraCaching strongly discourages caches that are listed on other sites (so-called double-listing).{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.terracaching.com/\", \"title\": \"Welcome to TerraCaching.com\"}\n\nExtremcaching\nExtremcaching is a German private database for alternative geocaches with a focus on T5 / Climbing Caches, Night Caches, Lost Place Caches. For extreme caching all you need is an extreme caching account, a GPS device with coordinates or a GPS-enabled smartphone with geocaching or outdoor navigation software, e.g. c:geo.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&tl=en&u=http://extremcaching.com\", \"title\": \"Google Translate\", \"website\": \"translate.google.com\"}{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://extremcaching.com/\", \"title\": \"Extremcaching - T5 + Lost Place Geocaching\", \"website\": \"extremcaching.com\", \"language\": \"de-de\"}\n\nSlang\nGeocaching slang includes: \n"}
