    "content": "Woodworking\nWoodworking is the activity or skill of making items from wood, and includes cabinet making (cabinetry and furniture), wood carving, joinery, carpentry, and woodturning.\n\nHistory\nAlong with stone, clay and animal parts, wood was one of the first materials worked by early humans. Microwear analysis of the Mousterian stone tools used by the Neanderthals show that many were used to work wood. The development of civilization was closely tied to the development of increasingly greater degrees of skill in working these materials.\nAmong early finds of wooden tools are the worked sticks from Kalambo Falls, Clacton-on-Sea and Lehringen. The spears from Sch\u00f6ningen (Germany) provide some of the first examples of wooden hunting gear. Flint tools were used for carving. Since Neolithic times, carved wooden vessels are known, for example, from the Linear Pottery culture wells at K\u00fcckhofen and Eythra.\nExamples of Bronze Age wood-carving include tree trunks worked into coffins from northern Germany and Denmark and wooden folding-chairs. The site of Fellbach-Schmieden in Germany has provided fine examples of wooden animal statues from the Iron Age. Wooden idols from the La T\u00e8ne period are known from a sanctuary at the source of the Seine in France.\n\nAncient Egypt\nThere is significant evidence of advanced woodworking in ancient Egypt.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"1994\", \"title\": \"Egyptian Woodworking and Furniture\", \"publisher\": \"Shire Publications\", \"isbn\": \"0747802394\", \"author\": \"Killen, Geoffrey\"} Woodworking is depicted in many extant ancient Egyptian drawings, and a considerable amount of ancient Egyptian furniture (such as stools, chairs, tables, beds, chests) have been preserved. Tombs represent a large collection of these artefacts and the inner coffins found in the tombs were also made of wood. The metal used by the Egyptians for woodworking tools was originally copper and eventually, after 2000 BC bronze as ironworking was unknown until much later.[2]\nCommonly used woodworking tools included axes, adzes, chisels, pull saws, and bow drills. Mortise and tenon joints are attested from the earliest Predynastic period. These joints were strengthened using pegs, dowels and leather or cord lashings. Animal glue came to be used only in the New Kingdom period.[3] Ancient Egyptians invented the art of veneering and used varnishes for finishing, though the composition of these varnishes is unknown. Although different native acacias were used, as was the wood from the local sycamore and tamarisk trees, deforestation in the Nile valley resulted in the need for the importation of wood, notably cedar, but also Aleppo pine, boxwood and oak, starting from the Second Dynasty.[4]\n\nAncient Rome\nWoodworking was essential to the Romans. It provided, sometimes the only, material for buildings, transportation, tools, and household items. Wood also provided pipes, dye, waterproofing materials, and energy for heat.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"2008\", \"title\": \"Roman Woodworking\", \"publisher\": \"Yale University Press\", \"isbn\": \"9780300134605\", \"oclc\": \"192003268\", \"author\": \"Ulrich, Roger B.\"}:1Although most examples of Roman woodworking have been lost,{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"2008\", \"title\": \"Roman Woodworking\", \"publisher\": \"Yale University Press\", \"isbn\": \"9780300134605\", \"oclc\": \"192003268\", \"author\": \"Ulrich, Roger B.\"}:2 the literary record preserved much of the contemporary knowledge. Vitruvius dedicates an entire chapter of his De architectura to timber, preserving many details.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"title\": \"De architectura\", \"at\": \"1:2.9.1\", \"author\": \"Vitruvius\", \"authorlink\": \"Vitruvius\"} Pliny, while not a botanist, dedicated six books of his Natural History to trees and woody plants, providing a wealth of information on trees and their uses.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"title\": \"Natural History\", \"url\": \"https://archive.org/details/naturalhistory07plinuoft\", \"author\": \"Pliny\", \"authorlink\": \"Pliny_the_Elder\"}\n\nAncient China\nThe progenitors of Chinese woodworking are considered to be Lu Ban (\u9b6f\u73ed) and his wife Lady Yun, from the Spring and Autumn period (771 to 476 BC).  Lu Ban is said to have introduced the plane, chalk-line, and other tools to China. His teachings were supposedly left behind in the book Lu Ban Jing (\u9b6f\u73ed\u7d93, \"Manuscript of Lu Ban\"). Despite this, it is believed that the text was written some 1500 years after his death. This book is filled largely with descriptions of dimensions for use in building various items such as flower pots, tables, altars, etc., and also contains extensive instructions concerning Feng Shui. It mentions almost nothing of the intricate glue-less and nail-less joinery for which Chinese furniture was so famous.\n\nModern day\nWith the advances in modern technology and the demands of industry, woodwork as a field has changed. The development of Computer Numeric Controlled (CNC) Machines, for example, has made us able to mass-produce and reproduce products faster, with less waste, and often more complex in design than ever before. CNC wood routers can carve complicated and highly detailed shapes into flat stock, to create signs or art.  Rechargeable power tools speed up creation of many projects and require much less body strength than in the past, for example when boring multiple holes. Skilled fine woodworking, however, remains a craft pursued by many. There remains demand for hand crafted work such as furniture and arts, however with rate and cost of production, the cost for consumers is much higher.\n\nMaterials\nHistorically, woodworkers relied upon the woods native to their region, until transportation and trade innovations made more exotic woods available to the craftsman. Woods are typically sorted into three basic types: hardwoods typified by tight grain and derived from broadleaf trees, softwoods from coniferous trees, and man-made materials such as plywood and MDF.\nHardwoods, botanically known as angiosperms, are deciduous and shed their leaves annually with temperature changes.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.hardwooddistributors.org/blog/tag/differences-american-hardwoods-and-tropical-hardwoods/\", \"title\": \"differences American hardwoods and tropical hardwoods {{!}} Hardwood Distributors\", \"website\": \"www.hardwooddistributors.org\", \"language\": \"en-US\", \"accessdate\": \"2018-04-16\"} Softwoods come from trees botanically known as gymnosperms, which are coniferous, cone-bearing, and stay green year round.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.hardwooddistributors.org/blog/tag/differences-american-hardwoods-and-tropical-hardwoods/\", \"title\": \"differences American hardwoods and tropical hardwoods {{!}} Hardwood Distributors\", \"website\": \"www.hardwooddistributors.org\", \"language\": \"en-US\", \"accessdate\": \"2018-04-16\"} Although a general pattern, softwoods are not necessarily always \u201csofter\u201d than hardwoods, and vice versa.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"date\": \"2012\", \"title\": \"The practical woodworker : a comprehensive step-by-step course in working with wood\", \"url\": \"https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/801605649\", \"others\": \"Freeman, John.\", \"location\": \"Wigston\", \"publisher\": \"Southwater\", \"isbn\": \"1780192207\", \"oclc\": \"801605649\", \"last\": \"Stephen.\", \"first\": \"Corbett,\"}\nSoftwood is most commonly found in the regions of the world with lower temperatures and is typically less durable, lighter in weight, and more vulnerable to pests and fungal attacks in comparison to hardwoods. They typically have a paler color and a more open grain than hardwoods, which contributes to the tendency of felled softwood to shrink and swell as it dries.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"date\": \"2012\", \"title\": \"The practical woodworker : a comprehensive step-by-step course in working with wood\", \"url\": \"https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/801605649\", \"others\": \"Freeman, John.\", \"location\": \"Wigston\", \"publisher\": \"Southwater\", \"isbn\": \"1780192207\", \"oclc\": \"801605649\", \"last\": \"Stephen.\", \"first\": \"Corbett,\"} Softwoods usually have a lower density, around 25-37lb/cu ft, which can compromise its strength.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"date\": \"2012\", \"title\": \"The practical woodworker : a comprehensive step-by-step course in working with wood\", \"url\": \"https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/801605649\", \"others\": \"Freeman, John.\", \"location\": \"Wigston\", \"publisher\": \"Southwater\", \"isbn\": \"1780192207\", \"oclc\": \"801605649\", \"last\": \"Stephen.\", \"first\": \"Corbett,\"} Density, however, does vary within both softwoods and hardwoods depending on the wood's geographical origin and growth rate. However, the lower density of softwoods also allows it to have a greater strength with lighter weight. In the United States, softwoods are typically cheaper and more readily available and accessible.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"date\": \"2012\", \"title\": \"The practical woodworker : a comprehensive step-by-step course in working with wood\", \"url\": \"https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/801605649\", \"others\": \"Freeman, John.\", \"location\": \"Wigston\", \"publisher\": \"Southwater\", \"isbn\": \"1780192207\", \"oclc\": \"801605649\", \"last\": \"Stephen.\", \"first\": \"Corbett,\"} Most softwoods are suitable for general construction, especially framing, trim, and finish work, and carcassing.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"date\": \"2003\", \"title\": \"Woodworking basics : mastering the essentials of craftsmanship\", \"url\": \"https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/51810586\", \"location\": \"Newtown, CT\", \"publisher\": \"Taunton Press\", \"isbn\": \"156158620X\", \"oclc\": \"51810586\", \"last\": \"1951\\u2013\", \"first\": \"Korn, Peter,\"}{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"date\": \"2012\", \"title\": \"The practical woodworker : a comprehensive step-by-step course in working with wood\", \"url\": \"https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/801605649\", \"others\": \"Freeman, John.\", \"location\": \"Wigston\", \"publisher\": \"Southwater\", \"isbn\": \"1780192207\", \"oclc\": \"801605649\", \"last\": \"Stephen.\", \"first\": \"Corbett,\"}\nHardwoods are separated into two categories, temperate and tropical hardwoods, depending on their origin. Temperate hardwoods are found in the regions between the tropics and poles, and are of particular interest to wood workers for their cost-effective aesthetic appeal and sustainable sources.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"date\": \"2012\", \"title\": \"The practical woodworker : a comprehensive step-by-step course in working with wood\", \"url\": \"https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/801605649\", \"others\": \"Freeman, John.\", \"location\": \"Wigston\", \"publisher\": \"Southwater\", \"isbn\": \"1780192207\", \"oclc\": \"801605649\", \"last\": \"Stephen.\", \"first\": \"Corbett,\"} Tropical hardwoods are found within the equatorial belt, including Africa, Asia, and South America. Hardwoods flaunt a higher density, around 65lb/cu ft as a result of slower growing rates and is more stable when drying.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"date\": \"2012\", \"title\": \"The practical woodworker : a comprehensive step-by-step course in working with wood\", \"url\": \"https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/801605649\", \"others\": \"Freeman, John.\", \"location\": \"Wigston\", \"publisher\": \"Southwater\", \"isbn\": \"1780192207\", \"oclc\": \"801605649\", \"last\": \"Stephen.\", \"first\": \"Corbett,\"} As a result of its high density, hardwoods are typically heavier than softwoods but can also be more brittle.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"date\": \"2012\", \"title\": \"The practical woodworker : a comprehensive step-by-step course in working with wood\", \"url\": \"https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/801605649\", \"others\": \"Freeman, John.\", \"location\": \"Wigston\", \"publisher\": \"Southwater\", \"isbn\": \"1780192207\", \"oclc\": \"801605649\", \"last\": \"Stephen.\", \"first\": \"Corbett,\"} While there are an abundant number of hardwood species, only 200 are common enough and pliable enough to be used for woodworking.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.lowes.com/projects/build-and-remodel/lumber-buying-guide/project\", \"title\": \"Lumber Buying Guide\", \"website\": \"www.lowes.com\", \"language\": \"en-US\", \"accessdate\": \"2018-04-16\"} Hardwoods have a wide variety of properties, making it easy to find a hardwood to suit nearly any purpose, but they are especially suitable for outdoor use due to their strength and resilience to rot and decay.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"date\": \"2012\", \"title\": \"The practical woodworker : a comprehensive step-by-step course in working with wood\", \"url\": \"https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/801605649\", \"others\": \"Freeman, John.\", \"location\": \"Wigston\", \"publisher\": \"Southwater\", \"isbn\": \"1780192207\", \"oclc\": \"801605649\", \"last\": \"Stephen.\", \"first\": \"Corbett,\"} The coloring of hardwoods ranges from light to very dark, making it especially versatile for aesthetic purposes. However, because hardwoods are more closely grained, they are typically harder to work than softwoods. They are also harder to acquire in the United States and, as a result, are more expensive.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"date\": \"2012\", \"title\": \"The practical woodworker : a comprehensive step-by-step course in working with wood\", \"url\": \"https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/801605649\", \"others\": \"Freeman, John.\", \"location\": \"Wigston\", \"publisher\": \"Southwater\", \"isbn\": \"1780192207\", \"oclc\": \"801605649\", \"last\": \"Stephen.\", \"first\": \"Corbett,\"}\nTypically furniture such as tables and chairs is made using solid stock from hardwoods due to its strength and resistance to warping.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"date\": \"2003\", \"title\": \"Woodworking basics : mastering the essentials of craftsmanship\", \"url\": \"https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/51810586\", \"location\": \"Newtown, CT\", \"publisher\": \"Taunton Press\", \"isbn\": \"156158620X\", \"oclc\": \"51810586\", \"last\": \"1951\\u2013\", \"first\": \"Korn, Peter,\"} Additionally, they also have a greater variety of grain patterns and color and take a finish better which allows the woodworker to exercise a great deal of artistic liberty.

Some furniture, such as the Windsor chair involve green woodworking, shaping with wood while it contains its natural moisture prior to drying.\n\nCedar\nCedars are strong, aromatic softwoods that are capable of enduring outdoor elements, the most common of which is the Western Red Cedar. Western Red Cedar can sustain wet environments without succumbing to rot, and as a result is commonly used for outdoor projects such as patios, outdoor furniture, and building exteriors. This wood can be easily found at most home centers for a moderate price.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"title\": \"Types of Wood for Woodworking \\u2013 dummies\", \"url\": \"http://www.dummies.com/crafts/types-of-wood-for-woodworking/\", \"work\": \"dummies\", \"language\": \"en-US\", \"accessdate\": \"2018-04-16\"}\n\nFir\nFir, also known as Douglas Fir, is very inexpensive and common at local home centers. It has a characteristic straight, pronounced grain with a red-brown tint. However, its grain pattern is relatively plain and it does not stain well, so Fir is commonly used when the finished product will be painted. While commonly used for building, this softwood would also be suitable for furniture-making.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"title\": \"Types of Wood for Woodworking \\u2013 dummies\", \"url\": \"http://www.dummies.com/crafts/types-of-wood-for-woodworking/\", \"work\": \"dummies\", \"language\": \"en-US\", \"accessdate\": \"2018-04-16\"}\n\nAsh\nThis hardwood is relatively easy to work with and takes stain well, but its white to light brown color with a straight grain is visually appealing on its own.

One of the most important is the workability of the wood: the way in which it responds when worked by hand or tools, the quality of the grain, and how it responds to adhesives and finishes.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"date\": \"2012\", \"title\": \"The practical woodworker : a comprehensive step-by-step course in working with wood\", \"url\": \"https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/801605649\", \"others\": \"Freeman, John.\", \"location\": \"Wigston\", \"publisher\": \"Southwater\", \"isbn\": \"1780192207\", \"oclc\": \"801605649\", \"last\": \"Stephen.\", \"first\": \"Corbett,\"} When the workability of wood is high, it offers a lower resistance when cutting and has a diminished blunting effect on tools.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"date\": \"2012\", \"title\": \"The practical woodworker : a comprehensive step-by-step course in working with wood\", \"url\": \"https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/801605649\", \"others\": \"Freeman, John.\", \"location\": \"Wigston\", \"publisher\": \"Southwater\", \"isbn\": \"1780192207\", \"oclc\": \"801605649\", \"last\": \"Stephen.\", \"first\": \"Corbett,\"} Highly workable wood is easier to manipulate into desired forms. If the wood grain is straight and even, it will be much easier to create strong and durable glued joints. Additionally, it will help protect the wood from splitting when nailed or screwed.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"date\": \"2012\", \"title\": \"The practical woodworker : a comprehensive step-by-step course in working with wood\", \"url\": \"https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/801605649\", \"others\": \"Freeman, John.\", \"location\": \"Wigston\", \"publisher\": \"Southwater\", \"isbn\": \"1780192207\", \"oclc\": \"801605649\", \"last\": \"Stephen.\", \"first\": \"Corbett,\"} Coarse grains require a lengthy process of filing and rubbing down the grain to produce a smooth result.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"date\": \"2012\", \"title\": \"The practical woodworker : a comprehensive step-by-step course in working with wood\", \"url\": \"https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/801605649\", \"others\": \"Freeman, John.\", \"location\": \"Wigston\", \"publisher\": \"Southwater\", \"isbn\": \"1780192207\", \"oclc\": \"801605649\", \"last\": \"Stephen.\", \"first\": \"Corbett,\"}\nAnother important factor to be considered is the durability of the wood, especially in regards to moisture. If the finished project will be exposed to moisture (e.g. outdoor projects) or high humidity or condensation (e.g. in kitchens or bathrooms), then the wood needs to be especially durable in order to prevent rot. Because of their oily qualities, many tropical hardwoods such as teak and mahogany are popular for such applications.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"date\": \"2012\", \"title\": \"The practical woodworker : a comprehensive step-by-step course in working with wood\", \"url\": \"https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/801605649\", \"others\": \"Freeman, John.\", \"location\": \"Wigston\", \"publisher\": \"Southwater\", \"isbn\": \"1780192207\", \"oclc\": \"801605649\", \"last\": \"Stephen.\", \"first\": \"Corbett,\"}\n\nWoods with good working properties{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"date\": \"2012\", \"title\": \"The practical woodworker : a comprehensive step-by-step course in working with wood\", \"url\": \"https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/801605649\", \"others\": \"Freeman, John.\", \"location\": \"Wigston\", \"publisher\": \"Southwater\", \"isbn\": \"1780192207\", \"oclc\": \"801605649\", \"last\": \"Stephen.\", \"first\": \"Corbett,\"}\nAgba (Gossweilerodendron balsamiferum)\nAlder (Alnus glutinosa)\nBasswood (Tilia americana)\nObeah (Triplochiton scleroxylon)\nPine (Pinus)\nWestern Cedar (Thuja plicata)\n\nVery durable woods{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"date\": \"2012\", \"title\": \"The practical woodworker : a comprehensive step-by-step course in working with wood\", \"url\": \"https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/801605649\", \"others\": \"Freeman, John.\", \"location\": \"Wigston\", \"publisher\": \"Southwater\", \"isbn\": \"1780192207\", \"oclc\": \"801605649\", \"last\": \"Stephen.\", \"first\": \"Corbett,\"}\nTeak (Tectona grandis)\nIron (Milicia excelsa)\nJarrah (Eucalyptus marginata)\nChestnut (Castanea)\nOak (Quercus)\nCedar (Thuja)\n\nWoods used for carving\nWhile many woods can be used for carving, there are some clear favorites, including Aspen, Basswood, Butternut, Black Walnut, and Oak.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.hardwooddistributors.org/blog/postings/top-hardwoods-for-carving/\", \"title\": \"Top Hardwoods for Carving {{!}} Hardwood Distributors\", \"website\": \"www.hardwooddistributors.org\", \"language\": \"en-US\", \"accessdate\": \"2018-04-16\"} Because it has almost no grain and is notably soft, Basswood is particularly popular with beginner carvers.

Each area of woodworking requires a different variation of tools. Power tools and hand tools are both used for woodworking. Many modern woodworkers choose to use power tools in their trade for the added ease and to save time. However, many choose to still use only hand tools for several reasons such as the experience and the added character to the work. While some choose to use only hand tools simply for their own enjoyment.\n\nHand Tools\nHand tools are classified as tools that receive power only from the hands that are holding them. The more common modern hand tools are:\n\nClamps-\nClamps are used to hold your workpiece while either being cut, drilled, or glued. Clamps vary in all shapes and sizes from small c-clamps to very large bar or strap clamps.[16]\n\nChisels-\nChisels are tools with a long blade, a cutting edge, and a handle. Used for cutting and shaping wood or other materials.[16]\n\nClaw Hammer-\nThe claw hammer is the hammer of choice for anyone in woodworking because of the multi-use claw for pilling nails or prying against joints.[16]\n\nSquare-\nThe square is used to measure perfect angles on any workpiece.There are many different types of squares available.
