    "content": "Volleyball\n\nVolleyball is a team sport in which two teams of six players are separated by a net. Each team tries to score points by grounding a ball on the other team's court under organized rules.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.olympic.org/uk/sports/programme/index_uk.asp?SportCode=VB\", \"title\": \"Volleyball\", \"publisher\": \"[[International Olympic Committee]]\", \"accessdate\": \"2007-03-21\"} It has been a part of the official program of the Summer Olympic Games since Tokyo 1964.\nThe complete set of rules are extensive,{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.fivb.org/EN/Refereeing-Rules/documents/FIVB-Volleyball_Rules_2017-2020-EN-v06.pdf\", \"title\": \"Official Volleyball Rules, 2017\\u20132020\", \"publisher\": \"[[F\\u00e9d\\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|35th FIVB World Congress, Buenos Aires, Argentina, 2016]]\", \"accessdate\": \"2019-01-11\"} but play essentially proceeds as follows: a player on one of the teams begins a 'rally' by serving the ball (tossing or releasing it and then hitting it with a hand or arm), from behind the back boundary line of the court, over the net, and into the receiving team's court.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"date\": \"2003\", \"title\": \"Volleyball fundamentals\", \"url\": \"https://archive.org/details/volleyballfundam0000dear\", \"location\": \"Champaign, IL\", \"publisher\": \"Human Kinetics\", \"isbn\": \"0736045082\", \"oclc\": \"50643900\", \"last\": \"Joel.\", \"first\": \"Dearing,\", \"urlaccess\": \"registration\"} The receiving team must not let the ball be grounded within their court.

The team that wins the rally is awarded a point and serves the ball to start the next rally. A few of the most common faults include:\nThe ball is usually played with the hands or arms, but players can legally strike or push (short contact) the ball with any part of the body.\nA number of consistent techniques have evolved in volleyball, including spiking and blocking (because these plays are made above the top of the net, the vertical jump is an athletic skill emphasized in the sport) as well as passing, setting, and specialized player positions and offensive and defensive structures.\n\nOrigin of volleyball\nIn the winter of 1895,{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://cdm16122.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/p16122coll3/id/389/\", \"title\": \"The International Association Training School Notes (vol. 4 no. 8), October, 1895\"} in Holyoke, Massachusetts (United States), William G. Morgan, a YMCA physical education director, created a new game called Mintonette, a name derived from the game of badminton,{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.newenglandhistoricalsociety.com/15634-2/\", \"title\": \"In 1895, William Morgan Invents Mintonette\", \"publisher\": \"New England Historical Society\", \"accessdate\": \"2 January 2018\", \"quote\": \"Putting his mind to the challenge, Morgan examined the rules of sports such as baseball, basketball, handball and badminton. Taking pieces from each, he created a game he called Mintonette, deriving the name from badminton\"} as a pastime to be played (preferably) indoors and by any number of players. The game took some of its characteristics from other sports such as tennis and handball.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"title\": \"Bet You Don't Know Where Volleyball Came From\", \"url\": \"https://www.thoughtco.com/invention-and-history-of-volleyball-william-morgan-1992597\", \"work\": \"ThoughtCo\", \"accessdate\": \"2018-08-04\"} Another indoor sport, basketball, was catching on in the area, having been invented just ten miles (sixteen kilometres) away in the city of Springfield, Massachusetts, only four years before. Mintonette was designed to be an indoor sport, less rough than basketball, for older members of the YMCA, while still requiring a bit of athletic effort.\nThe first rules, written down by William G Morgan, called for a net 6\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in (1.98\u00a0m) high, a 25\u00a0ft \u00d7\u00a050\u00a0ft (7.6\u00a0m \u00d7\u00a015.2\u00a0m) court, and any number of players. A match was composed of nine innings with three serves for each team in each inning, and no limit to the number of ball contacts for each team before sending the ball to the opponents' court. In case of a serving error, a second try was allowed. Hitting the ball into the net was considered a foul (with loss of the point or a side-out)\u2014except in the case of the first-try serve.\nAfter an observer, Alfred Halstead, noticed the volleying nature of the game at its first exhibition match in 1896, played at the International YMCA Training School (now called Springfield College), the game quickly became known as volleyball (it was originally spelled as two words: \"volley ball\"). Volleyball rules were slightly modified by the International YMCA Training School and the game spread around the country to various YMCAs.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.fivb.com/EN/volleyball/story.htm\", \"title\": \"The Volleyball Story\", \"publisher\": \"F\\u00e9d\\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball (FIVB)\", \"accessdate\": \"2007-09-21\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20070127012658/http://www.fivb.com/EN/Volleyball/story.htm\", \"archivedate\": \"January 27, 2007\"}{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.ncva.com/page.aspx?id=14\", \"title\": \"How Volleyball Began\", \"publisher\": \"Northern California Volleyball Association\", \"accessdate\": \"2007-09-21\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20070701143054/http://www.ncva.com/page.aspx?id=14\", \"archivedate\": \"July 1, 2007\"}\n\nRefinements and later developments\nThe first official ball used in volleyball is disputed; some sources say Spalding created the first official ball in 1896, while others claim it was created in 1900.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"url \": \"http://volleyball.org/history.html\", \"title \": \"History Of Volleyball\", \"accessdate \": \"2007-09-21\", \"publisher \": \"Volleyball World Wide\", \"archiveurl \": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20110513035616/http://www.volleyball.org/history.html\", \"archivedate \": \"2011-05-13\"}{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url \": \"http://www.sportsknowhow.com/volleyball/history/volleyball-history.shtml\", \"title \": \"History of Volleyball\", \"accessdate \": \"2007-09-21\", \"publisher \": \"SportsKnowHow.com\"}{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"url \": \"http://www.volleyball.com/volleyball_history.aspx\", \"title \": \"History of Volleyball\", \"accessdate \": \"2007-09-21\", \"publisher \": \"volleyball.com\", \"archiveurl \": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20070924042339/http://www.volleyball.com/volleyball_history.aspx\", \"archivedate \": \"2007-09-24\"} The rules evolved over time: in 1916, in the Philippines, the skill and power of the set and spike had been introduced, and four years later a \"three hits\" rule and a rule against hitting from the back row were established.

If the team that won the point served in the previous point, the same player serves again. If the team that won the point did not serve the previous point, the players of the team acquiring the serve rotate their position on the court in a clockwise manner. The game continues, with the first team to score 25 points by a two-point margin awarded the set. Matches are best-of-five sets and the fifth set, if necessary, is usually played to 15 points.

When the ball is not in play, the libero can replace any back-row player, without prior notice to the officials. This replacement does not count against the substitution limit each team is allowed per set, although the libero may be replaced only by the player whom he or she replaced. Most U.S. high schools added the libero position from 2003 to 2005.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"May 14, 2003\", \"title\": \"H.S. volleyball makes big changes\", \"url\": \"https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=5hklAAAAIBAJ&sjid=9Q8GAAAAIBAJ&pg=753%2C61663\", \"location\": \"(Washington)\", \"page\": \"B2\", \"newspaper\": \"Arlington Times\", \"last\": \"Chandler\", \"first\": \"Rob\"}{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"October 5, 2005\", \"title\": \"Volleyball players adjusting to libero role\", \"url\": \"https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=sxZUAAAAIBAJ&sjid=AToNAAAAIBAJ&pg=3289%2C2152977\", \"location\": \"(Tonganoxie, Kansas)\", \"page\": \"1B\", \"newspaper\": \"The Mirror\", \"last\": \"Linenberger\", \"first\": \"Shawn\"}\nThe modern-day libero often takes on the role of a second setter. When the setter digs the ball, the libero is typically responsible for the second ball and sets to the front row attacker. The libero may function as a setter only under certain restrictions. To make an overhand set, the libero must be standing behind (and not stepping on) the 3-meter line; otherwise, the ball cannot be attacked above the net in front of the 3-meter line. An underhand pass is allowed from any part of the court.\nThe libero is, generally, the most skilled defensive player on the team. There is also a libero tracking sheet, where the referees or officiating team must keep track of whom the libero subs in and out for. Under FIVB rules, two liberos are designated at the beginning of the play, only one of whom can be on the court at any time.\nFurthermore, a libero is not allowed to serve, according to international rules. NCAA rules for both men and women differ on this point; a 2004 rule change allows the libero to serve, but only in a specific rotation. That is, the libero can only serve for one person, not for all of the people for whom he or she goes in. That rule change was also applied to high school and junior high play soon after.\n\nRecent rule changes\nOther rule changes enacted in 2000 include allowing serves in which the ball touches the net, as long as it goes over the net into the opponents' court. Also, the service area was expanded to allow players to serve from anywhere behind the end line but still within the theoretical extension of the sidelines. Other changes were made to lighten up calls on faults for carries and double-touches, such as allowing multiple contacts by a single player (\"double-hits\") on a team's first contact provided that they are a part of a single play on the ball.\nIn 2008, the NCAA changed the minimum number of points needed to win any of the first four sets from 30 to 25 for women's volleyball (men's volleyball remained at 30 for another three years, switching to 25 in 2011.) If a fifth (deciding) set is reached, the minimum required score remains at 15. In addition, the word \"game\" is now referred to as \"set\".{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.ncaa.org/wps/wcm/connect/resources/file/ebcecd09e29bb24/Summaryofchanges-final_post-PROP.pdf?MOD=AJPERES\", \"title\": \"2008 Major Rules-Change Proposals\", \"date\": \"2008-07-14\", \"publisher\": \"National Collegiate Athletic Association\", \"accessdate\": \"2008-10-12\", \"work\": \"ncaa.org\"}\nThe Official Volleyball Rules are prepared and updated every few years by the FIVB's Rules of the Game and Refereeing Commission.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.fivb.org/EN/FIVB/RotG_Refereeing_Commission.asp\", \"title\": \"FIVB Structure\", \"publisher\": \"FIVB\", \"accessdate\": \"2019-01-11\"} The latest edition is usually available on the FIVB's website.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.fivb.org/EN/Refereeing-Rules/documents/FIVB-Volleyball_Rules_2017-2020-EN-v06.pdf\", \"title\": \"Official Volleyball Rules, 2017\\u20132020\", \"publisher\": \"[[F\\u00e9d\\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|35th FIVB World Congress, Buenos Aires, Argentina, 2016]]\", \"accessdate\": \"2019-01-11\"}\n\nSkills\nCompetitive teams master six basic skills: serve, pass, set, attack, block and dig.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"date\": \"2003\", \"title\": \"Volleyball fundamentals\", \"url\": \"https://archive.org/details/volleyballfundam0000dear\", \"location\": \"Champaign, IL\", \"publisher\": \"Human Kinetics\", \"isbn\": \"0736045082\", \"oclc\": \"50643900\", \"last\": \"Joel.\", \"first\": \"Dearing,\", \"urlaccess\": \"registration\"} Each of these skills comprises a number of specific techniques that have been introduced over the years and are now considered standard practice in high-level volleyball.\n\nServe\nA player stands behind the inline and serves the ball, in an attempt to drive it into the opponent's court. The main objective is to make it land inside the court; it is also desirable to set the ball's direction, speed and acceleration so that it becomes difficult for the receiver to handle it properly.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"date\": \"2003\", \"title\": \"Volleyball fundamentals\", \"url\": \"https://archive.org/details/volleyballfundam0000dear\", \"location\": \"Champaign, IL\", \"publisher\": \"Human Kinetics\", \"isbn\": \"0736045082\", \"oclc\": \"50643900\", \"last\": \"Joel.\", \"first\": \"Dearing,\", \"urlaccess\": \"registration\"} A serve is called an \"ace\" when the ball lands directly onto the court or travels outside the court after being touched by an opponent; when the only player on the server's team to touch the ball is the server.\nIn contemporary volleyball, many types of serves are employed:\n\nPass\nAlso called reception, the pass is the attempt by a team to properly handle the opponent's serve or any form of attack. Proper handling includes not only preventing the ball from touching the court but also making it reach the position where the setter is standing quickly and precisely.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"date\": \"2003\", \"title\": \"Volleyball fundamentals\", \"url\": \"https://archive.org/details/volleyballfundam0000dear\", \"location\": \"Champaign, IL\", \"publisher\": \"Human Kinetics\", \"isbn\": \"0736045082\", \"oclc\": \"50643900\", \"last\": \"Joel.\", \"first\": \"Dearing,\", \"urlaccess\": \"registration\"}\nThe skill of passing involves fundamentally two specific techniques: underarm pass, or bump, where the ball touches the inside part of the joined forearms or platform, at waistline; and overhand pass, where it is handled with the fingertips, like a set, above the head.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"date\": \"2003\", \"title\": \"Volleyball fundamentals\", \"url\": \"https://archive.org/details/volleyballfundam0000dear\", \"location\": \"Champaign, IL\", \"publisher\": \"Human Kinetics\", \"isbn\": \"0736045082\", \"oclc\": \"50643900\", \"last\": \"Joel.\", \"first\": \"Dearing,\", \"urlaccess\": \"registration\"} Either are acceptable in professional and beach volleyball; however, there are much tighter regulations on the overhand pass in beach volleyball. When a player passes a ball to their setter, it's ideal that the ball does not have a lot of spin to make it easier for the setter.\n\nSet\nThe set is usually the second contact that a team makes with the ball.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"date\": \"2003\", \"title\": \"Volleyball fundamentals\", \"url\": \"https://archive.org/details/volleyballfundam0000dear\", \"location\": \"Champaign, IL\", \"publisher\": \"Human Kinetics\", \"isbn\": \"0736045082\", \"oclc\": \"50643900\", \"last\": \"Joel.\", \"first\": \"Dearing,\", \"urlaccess\": \"registration\"} The main goal of setting is to put the ball in the air in such a way that it can be driven by an attack into the opponent's court.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"date\": \"2003\", \"title\": \"Volleyball fundamentals\", \"url\": \"https://archive.org/details/volleyballfundam0000dear\", \"location\": \"Champaign, IL\", \"publisher\": \"Human Kinetics\", \"isbn\": \"0736045082\", \"oclc\": \"50643900\", \"last\": \"Joel.\", \"first\": \"Dearing,\", \"urlaccess\": \"registration\"} The setter coordinates the offensive movements of a team, and is the player who ultimately decides which player will actually attack the ball.\nAs with passing, one may distinguish between an overhand and a bump set. Since the former allows for more control over the speed and direction of the ball, the bump is used only when the ball is so low it cannot be properly handled with fingertips, or in beach volleyball where rules regulating overhand setting are more stringent. In the case of a set, one also speaks of a front or back set, meaning whether the ball is passed in the direction the setter is facing or behind the setter. There is also a jump set that is used when the ball is too close to the net. In this case, the setter usually jumps off their right foot straight up to avoid going into the net. The setter usually stands about \u2154 of the way from the left to the right of the net and faces the left (the larger portion of net that he or she can see).\nSometimes a setter refrains from raising the ball for a teammate to perform an attack and tries to play it directly onto the opponent's court. This movement is called a \"dump\".{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.srcf.ucam.org/cuvc/club/glossary.php\", \"title\": \"Volleyball glossary\", \"publisher\": \"Cambridge University Volleyball Club\", \"accessdate\": \"2007-03-20\"} This can only be performed when the setter is in the front row, otherwise it constitutes an illegal back court attack. The most common dumps are to 'throw' the ball behind the setter or in front of the setter to zones 2 and 4. More experienced setters toss the ball into the deep corners or spike the ball on the second hit.\nAs with a set or an overhand pass, the setter/passer must be careful to touch the ball with both hands at the same time.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"date\": \"2003\", \"title\": \"Volleyball fundamentals\", \"url\": \"https://archive.org/details/volleyballfundam0000dear\", \"location\": \"Champaign, IL\", \"publisher\": \"Human Kinetics\", \"isbn\": \"0736045082\", \"oclc\": \"50643900\", \"last\": \"Joel.\", \"first\": \"Dearing,\", \"urlaccess\": \"registration\"} If one hand is noticeably late to touch the ball this could result in a less effective set, as well as the referee calling a 'double hit' and giving the point to the opposing team.\n\nAttack\nThe attack, also known as the spike, is usually the third contact a team makes with the ball.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"date\": \"2003\", \"title\": \"Volleyball fundamentals\", \"url\": \"https://archive.org/details/volleyballfundam0000dear\", \"location\": \"Champaign, IL\", \"publisher\": \"Human Kinetics\", \"isbn\": \"0736045082\", \"oclc\": \"50643900\", \"last\": \"Joel.\", \"first\": \"Dearing,\", \"urlaccess\": \"registration\"} The object of attacking is to handle the ball so that it lands on the opponent's court and cannot be defended.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"date\": \"2003\", \"title\": \"Volleyball fundamentals\", \"url\": \"https://archive.org/details/volleyballfundam0000dear\", \"location\": \"Champaign, IL\", \"publisher\": \"Human Kinetics\", \"isbn\": \"0736045082\", \"oclc\": \"50643900\", \"last\": \"Joel.\", \"first\": \"Dearing,\", \"urlaccess\": \"registration\"} A player makes a series of steps (the \"approach\"), jumps, and swings at the ball.\nIdeally, the contact with the ball is made at the apex of the hitter's jump. At the moment of contact, the hitter's arm is fully extended above their head and slightly forward, making the highest possible contact while maintaining the ability to deliver a powerful hit. The hitter uses arm swing, wrist snap, and a rapid forward contraction of the entire body to drive the ball.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"date\": \"2003\", \"title\": \"Volleyball fundamentals\", \"url\": \"https://archive.org/details/volleyballfundam0000dear\", \"location\": \"Champaign, IL\", \"publisher\": \"Human Kinetics\", \"isbn\": \"0736045082\", \"oclc\": \"50643900\", \"last\": \"Joel.\", \"first\": \"Dearing,\", \"urlaccess\": \"registration\"} A 'bounce' is a slang term for a very hard/loud spike that follows an almost straight trajectory steeply downward into the opponent's court and bounces very high into the air. A \"kill\" is the slang term for an attack that is not returned by the other team thus resulting in a point.\nContemporary volleyball comprises a number of attacking techniques:\n\nBlock\nBlocking refers to the actions taken by players standing at the net to stop or alter an opponent's attack.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"date\": \"2003\", \"title\": \"Volleyball fundamentals\", \"url\": \"https://archive.org/details/volleyballfundam0000dear\", \"location\": \"Champaign, IL\", \"publisher\": \"Human Kinetics\", \"isbn\": \"0736045082\", \"oclc\": \"50643900\", \"last\": \"Joel.\", \"first\": \"Dearing,\", \"urlaccess\": \"registration\"}\nA block that is aimed at completely stopping an attack, thus making the ball remain in the opponent's court, is called offensive. A well-executed offensive block is performed by jumping and reaching to penetrate with one's arms and hands over the net and into the opponent's area.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"date\": \"2003\", \"title\": \"Volleyball fundamentals\", \"url\": \"https://archive.org/details/volleyballfundam0000dear\", \"location\": \"Champaign, IL\", \"publisher\": \"Human Kinetics\", \"isbn\": \"0736045082\", \"oclc\": \"50643900\", \"last\": \"Joel.\", \"first\": \"Dearing,\", \"urlaccess\": \"registration\"} It requires anticipating the direction the ball will go once the attack takes place.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"date\": \"2003\", \"title\": \"Volleyball fundamentals\", \"url\": \"https://archive.org/details/volleyballfundam0000dear\", \"location\": \"Champaign, IL\", \"publisher\": \"Human Kinetics\", \"isbn\": \"0736045082\", \"oclc\": \"50643900\", \"last\": \"Joel.\", \"first\": \"Dearing,\", \"urlaccess\": \"registration\"} It may also require calculating the best footwork to executing the \"perfect\" block.\nThe jump should be timed so as to intercept the ball's trajectory prior to it crossing over the plane of the net. Palms are held deflected downward roughly 45\u201360 degrees toward the interior of the opponents' court. A \"roof\" is a spectacular offensive block that redirects the power and speed of the attack straight down to the attacker's floor as if the attacker hit the ball into the underside of a peaked house roof.\nBy contrast, it is called a defensive, or \"soft\" block if the goal is to control and deflect the hard-driven ball up so that it slows down and becomes easier to defend. A well-executed soft-block is performed by jumping and placing one's hands above the net with no penetration into the opponent's court and with the palms up and fingers pointing backwards.\nBlocking is also classified according to the number of players involved. Thus, one may speak of single (or solo), double, or triple block.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"date\": \"2003\", \"title\": \"Volleyball fundamentals\", \"url\": \"https://archive.org/details/volleyballfundam0000dear\", \"location\": \"Champaign, IL\", \"publisher\": \"Human Kinetics\", \"isbn\": \"0736045082\", \"oclc\": \"50643900\", \"last\": \"Joel.\", \"first\": \"Dearing,\", \"urlaccess\": \"registration\"}\nSuccessful blocking does not always result in a \"roof\" and many times does not even touch the ball. While it is obvious that a block was a success when the attacker is roofed, a block that consistently forces the attacker away from their 'power' or preferred attack into a more easily controlled shot by the defence is also a highly successful block.\nAt the same time, the block position influences the positions where other defenders place themselves while opponent hitters are spiking.\n\nDig\nDigging is the ability to prevent the ball from touching one's court after a spike or attack, particularly a ball that is nearly touching the ground.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"date\": \"2003\", \"title\": \"Volleyball fundamentals\", \"url\": \"https://archive.org/details/volleyballfundam0000dear\", \"location\": \"Champaign, IL\", \"publisher\": \"Human Kinetics\", \"isbn\": \"0736045082\", \"oclc\": \"50643900\", \"last\": \"Joel.\", \"first\": \"Dearing,\", \"urlaccess\": \"registration\"} In many aspects, this skill is similar to passing, or bumping: overhand dig and bump are also used to distinguish between defensive actions taken with fingertips or with joined arms.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"date\": \"2003\", \"title\": \"Volleyball fundamentals\", \"url\": \"https://archive.org/details/volleyballfundam0000dear\", \"location\": \"Champaign, IL\", \"publisher\": \"Human Kinetics\", \"isbn\": \"0736045082\", \"oclc\": \"50643900\", \"last\": \"Joel.\", \"first\": \"Dearing,\", \"urlaccess\": \"registration\"} It varies from passing however in that is it a much more reflex based skill, especially at the higher levels. It is especially important while digging for players to stay on their toes; several players choose to employ a split step to make sure they're ready to move in any direction.\nSome specific techniques are more common in digging than in passing. A player may sometimes perform a \"dive\", i.e., throw their body in the air with a forward movement in an attempt to save the ball, and land on their chest. When the player also slides their hand under a ball that is almost touching the court, this is called a \"pancake\". The pancake is frequently used in indoor volleyball, but rarely if ever in beach volleyball because the uneven and yielding nature of the sand court limits the chances that the ball will make good, clean contact with the hand. When used correctly, it is one of the more spectacular defensive volleyball plays.\nSometimes a player may also be forced to drop their body quickly to the floor to save the ball. In this situation, the player makes use of a specific rolling technique to minimize the chances of injuries.\n\nTeam play\nVolleyball is essentially a game of transition from one of the above skills to the next, with choreographed team movement between plays on the ball. These team movements are determined by the teams chosen serve receive system, offensive system, coverage system, and defensive system.\nThe serve-receive system is the formation used by the receiving team to attempt to pass the ball to the designated setter. Systems can consist of 5 receivers, 4 receivers, 3 receivers, and in some cases 2 receivers. The most popular formation at higher levels is a 3 receiver formation consisting of two left sides and a libero receiving every rotation. This allows middles and right sides to become more specialized at hitting and blocking.\nOffensive systems are the formations used by the offence to attempt to ground the ball into the opposing court (or otherwise score points). Formations often include designated player positions with skill specialization (see Player specialization, below). Popular formations include the 4-2, 6-2, and 5-1 systems (see Formations, below). There are also several different attacking schemes teams can use to keep the opposing defence off balance.\nCoverage systems are the formations used by the offence to protect their court in the case of a blocked attack. Executed by the 5 offensive players not directly attacking the ball, players move to assigned positions around the attacker to dig up any ball that deflects off the block back into their own court. Popular formations include the 2-3 system and the 1-2-2 system. In lieu of a system, some teams just use a random coverage with the players nearest the hitter.\nDefensive systems are the formations used by the defence to protect against the ball being grounded into their court by the opposing team. The system will outline which players are responsible for which areas of the court depending on where the opposing team is attacking from. Popular systems include the 6-Up, 6-Back-Deep, and 6-Back-Slide defence. There are also several different blocking schemes teams can employ to disrupt the opposing teams' offence.\nWhen one player is ready to serve, some teams will line up their other five players in a screen to obscure the view of the receiving team. This action is only illegal if the server makes use of the screen, so the call is made at the referee's discretion as to the impact the screen made on the receiving team's ability to pass the ball. The most common style of screening involves a W formation designed to take up as much horizontal space as possible.\n\nPlayer specialization\nThere are five positions filled on every volleyball team at the elite level. Setter, Outside Hitter/Left Side Hitter, Middle Hitter, Opposite Hitter/Right Side Hitter and Libero/Defensive Specialist. Each of these positions plays a specific, key role in winning a volleyball match.\nAt some levels where substitutions are unlimited, teams will make use of a Defensive Specialist in place of or in addition to a Libero. This position does not have unique rules like the libero position, instead, these players are used to substitute out a poor back row defender using regular substitution rules. A defensive specialist is often used if you have a particularly poor back court defender in right side or left side, but your team is already using a libero to take out your middles. Most often, the situation involves a team using a right side player with a big block who must be subbed out in the back row because they aren't able to effectively play backcourt defence. Similarly, teams might use a Serving Specialist to sub out a poor server.\n\nFormations\nThe three standard volleyball formations are known as \"4\u20132\", \"6\u20132\" and \"5\u20131\", which refers to the number of hitters and setters respectively. 4\u20132 is a basic formation used only in beginners' play, while 5\u20131 is by far the most common formation in high-level play.\n\n4\u20132\nThe 4\u20132 formation has four hitters and two setters. The setters usually set from the middle front or right front position. The team will, therefore, have two front-row attackers at all times. In the international 4\u20132, the setters set from the right front position. The international 4\u20132 translates more easily into other forms of offence.\nThe setters line up opposite each other in the rotation. The typical lineup has two outside hitters. By aligning like positions opposite themselves in the rotation, there will always be one of each position in the front and back rows. After service, the players in the front row move into their assigned positions, so that the setter is always in the middle front. Alternatively, the setter moves into the right front and has both a middle and an outside attacker; the disadvantage here lies in the lack of an offside hitter, allowing one of the other team's blockers to \"cheat in\" on a middle block.\nThe clear disadvantage to this offensive formation is that there are only two attackers, leaving a team with fewer offensive weapons.\nAnother aspect is to see the setter as an attacking force, albeit a weakened force, because when the setter is in the frontcourt they are able to 'tip' or 'dump', so when the ball is close to the net on the second touch, the setter may opt to hit the ball over with one hand. This means that the blocker who would otherwise not have to block the setter is engaged and may allow one of the hitters to have an easier attack.\n\n6\u20132\nIn the 6\u20132 formation, a player always comes forward from the back row to set. The three front row players are all in attacking positions. Thus, all six players act as hitters at one time or another, while two can act as setters. So the 6\u20132 formation is actually a 4\u20132 system, but the back-row setter penetrates to set.\nThe 6\u20132 lineup thus requires two setters, who line up opposite to each other in the rotation. In addition to the setters, a typical lineup will have two middle hitters and two outside hitters. By aligning like positions opposite themselves in the rotation, there will always be one of each position in the front and back rows. After service, the players in the front row move into their assigned positions.\nThe advantage of the 6\u20132 is that there are always three front-row hitters available, maximizing the offensive possibilities. However, not only does the 6\u20132 require a team to possess two people capable of performing the highly specialized role of setter, it also requires both of those players to be effective offensive hitters when not in the setter position. At the international level, only the Cuban National Women's Team employs this kind of formation. It is also used by NCAA teams in Division III men's play and women's play in all divisions, partially due to the variant rules used which allow more substitutions per set than the 6 allowed in the standard rules\u201412 in matches involving two Division III men's teams{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.ncaa.org/sites/default/files/2015-17_MVB_Rules_Modification_20170104.pdf\", \"title\": \"NCAA Men's Volleyball 2015\\u201317 Rules Modifications\", \"date\": \"August 1, 2016\", \"publisher\": \"NCAA\", \"accessdate\": \"August 16, 2017\"} and 15 for all women's play.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/VBR17.pdf\", \"title\": \"Rule 11.3.2: Substitutions \\u2013 Limitations\", \"publisher\": \"NCAA\", \"page\": \"42\", \"accessdate\": \"August 16, 2017\", \"work\": \"Women's Volleyball 2016 and 2017 Rules and Interpretations\"}\n\n5\u20131\nThe 5\u20131 formation has only one player who assumes setting responsibilities regardless of their position in the rotation. The team will, therefore, have three front-row attackers when the setter is in the back row and only two when the setter is in the front row, for a total of five possible attackers.\nThe player opposite the setter in a 5\u20131 rotation is called the opposite hitter. In general, opposite hitters do not pass; they stand behind their teammates when the opponent is serving. The opposite hitter may be used as a third attack option (back-row attack) when the setter is in the front row: this is the normal option used to increase the attack capabilities of modern volleyball teams. Normally the opposite hitter is the most technically skilled hitter of the team. Back-row attacks generally come from the back-right position, known as zone 1, but are increasingly performed from back-centre in high-level play.\nThe big advantage of this system is that the setter always has 3 hitters to vary sets with. If the setter does this well, the opponent's middle blocker may not have enough time to block with the outside blocker, increasing the chance for the attacking team to make a point.\nThere is another advantage, the same as that of a 4\u20132 formation: when the setter is a front-row player, he or she is allowed to jump and \"dump\" the ball onto the opponent's side. This too can confuse the opponent's blocking players: the setter can jump and dump or can set to one of the hitters. A good setter knows this and thus won't only jump to dump or to set for a quick hit, but when setting outside as well to confuse the opponent.\nThe 5\u20131 offence is actually a mix of 6\u20132 and 4\u20132: when the setter is in the front row, the offense looks like a 4\u20132; when the setter is in the back row, the offense looks like a 6\u20132.\n\nControversies\nIn 2017, a new volleyball union was formed in response to dissatisfaction with the organization and structure of professional beach volleyball tournaments.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"title\": \"Pro beach volleyball players from around world form union - NY Daily News\", \"url\": \"http://www.nydailynews.com/newswires/sports/pro-beach-volleyball-players-world-form-union-article-1.3801193\", \"work\": \"nydailynews.com\", \"language\": \"en-US\", \"accessdate\": \"2018-08-04\", \"last\": \"Press\", \"first\": \"The Associated\"} The union is named the International Beach Volleyball Players Association, and it consists of almost 100 professional players.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"title\": \"Pro beach volleyball players from around world form union - NY Daily News\", \"url\": \"http://www.nydailynews.com/newswires/sports/pro-beach-volleyball-players-world-form-union-article-1.3801193\", \"work\": \"nydailynews.com\", \"language\": \"en-US\", \"accessdate\": \"2018-08-04\", \"last\": \"Press\", \"first\": \"The Associated\"} IBVPA claims its goal is to help athletes and provide them with the means to enjoy playing volleyball by improving the way the sport is run.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"title\": \"Pro beach volleyball players from around world form union - NY Daily News\", \"url\": \"http://www.nydailynews.com/newswires/sports/pro-beach-volleyball-players-world-form-union-article-1.3801193\", \"work\": \"nydailynews.com\", \"language\": \"en-US\", \"accessdate\": \"2018-08-04\", \"last\": \"Press\", \"first\": \"The Associated\"}\nAnother controversy within the sport is the issue of the inclusion of transgender players.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"title\": \"Transgender Volleyball Star in Brazil Eyes Olympics and Stirs Debate\", \"url\": \"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/world/americas/brazil-transgender-volleyball-tifanny-abreu.html\", \"language\": \"en\", \"accessdate\": \"2018-08-04\"} With transgender athletes such as Tifanny Abreu joining professional volleyball teams alongside other non-transgender teammates, many professionals, sports analysts, and fans of volleyball are either expressing concerns about the legitimacy and fairness of having transgender players on a team or expressing support for the transgender people's efforts.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"title\": \"Transgender Volleyball Star in Brazil Eyes Olympics and Stirs Debate\", \"url\": \"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/world/americas/brazil-transgender-volleyball-tifanny-abreu.html\", \"language\": \"en\", \"accessdate\": \"2018-08-04\"}\n\nVariations and related games\nThere are many variations on the basic rules of volleyball.
