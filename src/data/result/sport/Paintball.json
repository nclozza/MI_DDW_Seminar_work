    "content": "Paintball\nPaintball is a competitive team shooting sport in which players eliminate opponents from play by hitting them with spherical dye-filled gelatin capsules called paintballs that break upon impact. Paintballs are usually shot using low-energy air weapons called paintball markers that are powered by compressed air (nitrogen) or carbon dioxide and were originally designed for remotely marking trees and cattle.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://nicolpawn.ca/paintball-blog.php/2011/05/27/history-of-paintball-markers\", \"title\": \"Paintball History > First Paintball Game\", \"website\": \"nicolpawn.ca\", \"accessdate\": \"2019-01-15\"}\nThe game was initially developed in May 1981 in New Hampshire by Hayes Noel, a Wall Street stock trader, and Charles Gaines, an outdoorsman and writer.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://nicolpawn.ca/paintball-blog.php/2011/05/27/history-of-paintball-markers\", \"title\": \"Paintball History > First Paintball Game\", \"website\": \"nicolpawn.ca\", \"accessdate\": \"2019-01-15\"} A debate arose between them about whether a city-dweller had the instinct to survive in the woods against a man who had spent his youth hunting, fishing, and building cabins. The two men chanced upon an advertisement for a paint gun in a farm catalogue and were inspired to use it to settle their argument with 10 other men all in individual competition, eventually creating the sport of paintball.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"2014-08-15\", \"title\": \"Who Made That Paintball?\", \"url\": \"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/17/magazine/who-made-that-paintball.html\", \"work\": \"The New York Times\", \"language\": \"en-US\", \"issn\": \"0362-4331\", \"accessdate\": \"2019-11-07\", \"last\": \"Slater\", \"first\": \"Dashka\"}\nThe sport is played for recreation and is also played at a formal sporting level with organized competition that involves major tournaments, professional teams, and players.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.themercury.com.au/article/2009/09/09/96241_tasmania-news.html\", \"title\": \"Push to legalise paintball\", \"date\": \"September 9, 2009\", \"publisher\": \"The Mercury\", \"accessdate\": \"October 31, 2014\", \"last \": \"Brown\", \"first \": \"Damien\", \"archiveurl \": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20110706112533/http://www.themercury.com.au/article/2009/09/09/96241_tasmania-news.html\", \"archivedate \": \"July 6, 2011\", \"urlstatus \": \"dead\"}{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/113363/sporting-goods-group-dissects-team-sports.html\", \"title\": \"Sporting Goods Group Dissects Team Sports\", \"date\": \"September 11, 2009\", \"publisher\": \"MediaPost Communications\", \"accessdate\": \"October 31, 2014\", \"last \": \"Greenberg\", \"first \": \"Karl\"} Paintball technology is also used by military forces, law enforcement, paramilitary, and security organizations to supplement military or other training.\nGames can be played on indoor or outdoor fields of varying sizes. A playing field may have natural or artificial terrain which players use for tactical cover. Game types and goals vary, but include capture the flag, elimination,  defending or attacking a particular point or area, or capturing objects of interest hidden in the playing area. Depending on the variant played, games can last from minutes to hours, or even days in \"scenario play\".\nThe legality of the sport and use of paintball markers varies among countries and regions. In most areas where regulated play is offered, players are required to wear protective masks, use barrel-blocking safety equipment, and strictly enforce safe game rules.\n\nEquipment\nThe paintball equipment used may depend on the game type, for example: woodsball, speedball, or scenario; on how much money one is willing to spend on equipment; and personal preference. However, almost every player will utilize three basic pieces of equipment:\nAdditional equipment, commonly seen among frequent players, tournament participants, and professional players include:\n\nGameplay\nPaintball is played with a potentially limitless variety of rules and variations, which are specified before the game begins. The most basic game rule is that players must attempt to accomplish a goal without being shot and marked with a paintball. A variety of different rules govern the legality of a hit, ranging from \"anything counts\" (hits cause elimination whether the paintball broke and left a mark or not) to the most common variation: the paintball must break and leave a mark the size of a US quarter or larger. Eliminated players are expected to leave the field of play; eliminations may also earn the opposing team points.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Zb4EAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ej4DAAAAIBAJ&pg=6957,13377142&dq=basic+paintball+rules\", \"title\": \"Paintball Planet features competitive fun\", \"publisher\": \"Cherokee County Herald\", \"accessdate\": \"September 16, 2009\", \"author\": \"McCarthy, Chris\"}{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.paintball-apl.com/APL%202003%20Rules%2004-03-03.pdf\", \"title\": \"APL Rules\", \"accessdate\": \"July 11, 2012\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20030502081811/http://www.paintball-apl.com/APL%202003%20Rules%2004-03-03.pdf\", \"archivedate\": \"May 2, 2003\"} Depending on the agreed upon game rules, the player may return to the field and continue playing, or is eliminated from the game completely.\nThe particular goal of the game is determined before play begins; examples include capture the flag{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"October 20, 1991\", \"title\": \"The Executive Life; The Satisfying Silliness Of the Paintball Wars\", \"url\": \"https://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/20/business/the-executive-life-the-satisfying-silliness-of-the-paintball-wars.html\", \"publisher\": \"The New York Times Company\", \"accessdate\": \"September 15, 2009\", \"author\": \"Billard, Mary\"} and elimination.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"January 13, 2005\", \"title\": \"Indoor paintball site targets the rapid growth of sport\", \"url\": \"http://www.boston.com/business/articles/2005/01/13/indoor_paintball_site_targets_the_rapid_growth_of_sport/\", \"accessdate\": \"September 15, 2009\", \"author\": \"Ewing, Bill\", \"newspaper\": \"The Boston Globe\"} Paintball has spawned popular variants, including woodsball, which is played in the natural environment and spans across a large area.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://media.www.dennews.com/media/storage/paper309/news/2007/09/28/TheVerge/Paintball.Addictive.To.Players-2998458.shtml\", \"title\": \"Paintball addictive to players\", \"date\": \"September 28, 2007\", \"publisher\": \"The Daily Eastern News\", \"accessdate\": \"September 15, 2009\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20101023010928/http://media.www.dennews.com/media/storage/paper309/news/2007/09/28/TheVerge/Paintball.Addictive.To.Players-2998458.shtml\", \"archivedate\": \"October 23, 2010\", \"author\": \"Peters, Kristina\"} Conversely, the variant of speedball is played on a smaller field and has a very fast pace with games as brief as two minutes fifteen seconds in the (NSL) or lasting up to twenty minutes in the PSP (Paintball Sports Promotions).{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.simivalleyacorn.com/news/2006-07-07/Sports/020.html\", \"title\": \"Paintball's popularity continues to spread\", \"publisher\": \"Simi Valley Acorn\", \"accessdate\": \"April 7, 2010\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20101126150440/http://www.simivalleyacorn.com/news/2006-07-07/Sports/020.html\", \"archivedate\": \"November 26, 2010\", \"author\": \"Gase, Thomas\"} Another variant is scenario paintball, in which players attempt to recreate historical, or fictional settings; the largest being Oklahoma D-Day's World War II re-enactment.[citation needed]\n\nWoodsball\nWoodsball, or \"Bushball\", is a fairly recent term that refers to what was the original form of the game:{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://prospaintball.com/history-of-paintball/\", \"title\": \"The Complete History of Paintball - Everything We Know!\", \"date\": \"2019-08-31\", \"website\": \"ProsPaintball.com\", \"language\": \"en-US\", \"accessdate\": \"2019-11-28\"} teams competing in a wooded or natural environment, in which varying amounts of stealth and concealment tactics can offer an advantage. The term is commonly used as a synonym for specialized scenario-based play, but it technically refers to virtually any form of paintball played in fields primarily composed of natural terrain and cover such as trees and berms, instead of manmade obstacles.\n\nScenario\nWoodsball may feature large or small teams, in competition to obtain various goals and objectives. Large-scale Woodsball games are commonly referred to as \"Big Games\" or \"Scenario Games\". Popular examples of the scenario format are Cousin's Big Game in Coram, New York (on Long Island), Hell Survivor's Monster Game (just outside Pinckney, Michigan), Invasion of Normandy at Skirmish U.S.A in Pennsylvania, Oklahoma D-Day (in Wyandotte, Oklahoma), Fight For Asylum at PRZ Paintball (Picton, Ontario), and Battle Royale at Flag Raiders Paintball (Kitchener, Ontario), events which draws in 2,000 to 4,500 players and last for two days, up to a week. Another variant of the Big Game is the \"Attack and Defend\" format where large numbers of attackers try to overrun a fixed, but a well-defended objective, such as a compound or large building.\n\nMilSim\nMilSim (\"Military Simulation\") is a mode of play designed to create an experience closer to military reality, where the attainment of specific objectives is the most important aspect of the game.\nMilSim addresses the logistics of combat, mission planning and execution, and dealing with limited resources and ammunition. Players are typically eliminated from the game when struck by paint. For aesthetic reasons, MilSim often uses airsoft guns rather than paintball guns, as their prominent hoppers appear unrealistic, however Airsoft pellets, being smaller caliber and fired at higher velocity, have an increased risk of player injury if the scenario involves high rates of fire or close range.\nWith the advent of shaped projectiles, such as the First Strike, and the resulting development of magazine fed markers, a considerable increase in range, accuracy and MILSIM realism was gained.  Functionally speaking, magazine-fed markers are no different than any other paintball marker, with one exception.  Instead of paintballs being gravity fed from a bulky hopper, which sits above the marker, shaped projectiles (or paintballs) are fed from a spring-loaded magazine from the bottom of the marker.  The caliber of both the gravity fed and magazine fed markers are the same (.68 caliber) and the velocities are also generally the same.  The increased range and accuracy of the shaped projectile comes from the higher ballistic coefficient that the shaped projectile has, and the gyroscopic spin imparted onto the projectile from a rifled barrel and fins on the projectile itself. Magazine fed markers and shaped projectiles have allowed marker designs to more closely approximate the styling and functionality of actual (real steel) firearms, which in turn has given paintball a better avenue to compete with Airsoft in the MilSiM environment.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.airsplat.com/MilSim\", \"title\": \"Airsoft MilSim - Military Simulation\", \"website\": \"www.airsplat.com\", \"accessdate\": \"2016-05-11\"}\n\nSpeedball\nSpeedball is played in an open field that could be compared to a soccer field, it is flat with a minimum of natural obstacles, and sometimes artificial turf is used, especially in indoor fields. The first speedball fields were constructed with flat wooden obstacles staked into the ground to provide cover; this concept was further developed into a number of urban-scenario field styles with larger building-like obstacles for casual play, but speedball itself progressed to using smaller obstacles made from plastic drainage pipe, which offered a more variable field layout and some \"give\" to the obstacles for increased safety. Eventually, inflatable fabric \"bunkers\" were developed based on common obstacle shapes from previous fields, such as \"snake\" and \"can\" bunkers. The use of inflatable obstacles both increases player safety by reducing potential injury from collisions with obstacles, and allows them to be easily moved to reconfigure the field or to set up temporary fields. Tournaments such as the PSP hold different events throughout the summer months all over the United States. Speedball games were originally started as a way to make the game safer for players who might trip on uneven woodland terrain. Speedball is generally a fast-paced game where many more balls are used than in woodsball style games. The Markers used are usually more \"High Tech\" in a sense that they are controlled by an electronic board and have very high rates of fire(upwards to 20 ball per second).\n\nConcept\nConcept Fields have many objects set up to allow players to remain hidden from their opponents. A concept field is a perfect man-made creation for paintball games. A field in this style is usually outdoors and almost always has a theme. There are a small amount of indoor fields, some have a theme, some speedball and some with a blend of woodsball game play in an indoor environment. Urban concept fields are often seen filled with cars, buildings, and other elements that are found in the city, though some concept field creators go all out and put together themes that may seem a bit over the top to those who aren't familiar with the sport.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.grippaintball.com/best-paintball-guns/\", \"title\": \"Grip Paintball\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20170219030953/http://www.grippaintball.com/best-paintball-guns/\", \"archivedate\": \"2017-02-19\"}\n\nEnforcement of game rules\nRegulated games are overseen by referees or marshals, who patrol the course to ensure enforcement of the rules and the safety of the players.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.mayhem-paintball.co.uk/about/Risk%20Assessement%20for%20Mayhem%20Paintballing%20London\", \"title\": \"Paintball Risk Assessement\"} If a player is marked with paint, they will call them out, but competitors may also be expected to follow the honor code; a broken ball means elimination. Field operators may specify variations to this rule, such as requiring a tag to certain body locations only \u2013 such as the head and torso only.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.stripes.com/article.asp?section=140&article=27733\", \"title\": \"Paintball warriors embrace fast and furious version known as 'speedball'\", \"date\": \"March 13, 2005\", \"publisher\": \"Stars and Stripes\", \"accessdate\": \"March 20, 2010\", \"author\": \"Zimmerman, Fred\"} There are game rules that can be enforced depending on the venue, to ensure safety, balance the fairness of the game or eliminate cheating.\n\nStrategy\nPlayer and team strategy varies depending on the size and layout of the field and the total number and experience level of players. The most basic strategy is to coordinate with the team to distribute the team members across the field roughly perpendicular to the line between starting stations to cover all potential lines of advance; a team that runs all in the same direction is easily flanked by opponents moving around the field on the opposite side. A second basic goal is to control as much of the field as possible, as early as possible, either by being the first to get to advantageous obstacles on the field or by quickly eliminating one or more opponents to reduce the number of directions each player has to watch for incoming paint. The more territory that the members of a team have behind them, the more options they have for choosing effective cover and changing position to get a good shot at one or more opponents, and because the field is of finite size, the fewer options the opposing team has.\nA key element of intermediate and advanced strategy is the concept of \"firing lanes\". These are clear lines of sight between obstacles on the field and thus potentially between opposing players on the field behind them. A lane is \"occupied\" if at least one player of the opposing team can fire along it, and it's \"active\" if any player is firing along it, friend or foe. Occupied and active lanes hinder player movement as the player risks getting hit and eliminated. Open fields with sparse cover often have long open lanes between most or all bunkers on the field, most of which will be occupied if not active. Therefore, players have to keep track of which lanes to and from their bunker become occupied by the other team, so the player can make sure the bunker is between themselves and the opponent(s). This becomes harder the more occupied firing lanes there are; when most available firing lanes on the field are occupied, each team has to create cover in at least one direction using suppressing fire (rounds sent to the opponent's location designed to keep their head down more than to eliminate them). Speedball, which tends to use small open fields with relatively few obstacles, requires each player to use hundreds of paintballs in the course of a game to keep his opponents pinned down, lest he be pinned himself. Conversely, if most firing lanes on the field are clear, players on each team have greater mobility and the use of covering fire to pin an opponent is less useful as the player can stay behind cover while moving long distances, so players tend to fire less and move more to gain clear shots. Urban scenarios and woodsball fields tend to be larger and with more cover, shortening firing lanes and requiring players to move more to get good shots against their opponent.\nTypically, strategy is limited for casual walk-on style paintball play. Some teamwork will be seen at the beginning of the games with brief discussions on tactics and strategy, such as distributing players between bunkers and assigning defenders that will stay back and cover attackers that advance. However, mid to late game tactics tend to be limited to groups of players sticking together or doing isolated attacks rather than a coordinated sweep down the field. In team paintball tournaments, more serious planned team tactics and strategy is seen throughout each game from the opening to the endgame. Teams generally practice together and have planned tactics they can use in the tournament, and know what each of their teammates will be trying to do in various situations during the game.\n\nPlaying venues\nPaintball is played at both commercial venues, which require paid admission, and private land; both of which may include multiple fields of varying size and layout. Fields can be scattered with either natural or artificial terrain,{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url \": \"http://www.paintballing.co.uk\", \"title \": \"Paintballing LTD\", \"accessdate \": \"October 14, 2015\"} and may also be themed to simulate a particular environment, such as a wooded or urban area, and may involve a historical context.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.timesnews.net/article.php?id=9008463\", \"title\": \"Video Report \\u2013 Blountville-based paintball team ranked fifth in nation, heading to World Championships\", \"date\": \"October 7, 2008\", \"publisher\": \"Kingsport Publishing Corporation\", \"accessdate\": \"October 31, 2014\", \"work\": \"www.timesnews.net\", \"last \": \"Smith\", \"first \": \"Rain\", \"archiveurl \": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20081013133046/http://timesnews.net/article.php?id=9008463\", \"archivedate \": \"October 13, 2008\", \"urlstatus \": \"dead\"} Smaller fields (such as those used for speedball and tournament play) may include an assortment of various inflatable bunkers; these fields are less prone to cause injury as the bunkers are little more than air bags, which can absorb the impact of a player colliding with them. Before these inflatable fields became available and popular, speedball fields were commonly constructed of various rigid building materials, such as plywood and framing timber, shipping pallets, even concrete and plastic drainage pipe. The use of plastic pipe tethered with stakes became common, as it allowed for relatively easy reconfiguration of fields and at least some impact-absorption, and was the precursor to the modern inflatable bunker (in fact, certain common features in inflatable fields, such as \"can\" and \"snake\" bunkers, were derived from similar features built with plastic drainage pipe). Recreational fields still commonly use these older materials for their higher durability and novelty; inflatable bunkers are prone to bursting seams or otherwise developing holes and leaks. Other fields have wooden or plastic barriers.\nCommercial venues may provide amenities such as bathrooms, picnic areas, lockers, equipment rentals, air refills and food service. Countries may have paintball sports guidelines, with rules on specific safety and insurance standards, and paid staff (including referees) who must ensure players are instructed in proper play to ensure participants' safety. Some fields are \"BYOP\" (Bring Your Own Paint), allowing players to buy paint at unrelated retail stores or online and use it at their field. However, most fields are FPO (Field Paint Only,) meaning players must buy paint at the venue or at a pro shop affiliated with the park. This is largely for revenue reasons; field and rental fees generally do not cover expenses of a paintball park. However, other reasons relating to player safety are generally cited and have some merit, as poor quality or poorly stored paint can cause gun failures or personal injury to targeted players.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.emrpaintball.com/fpo.shtml\", \"title\": \"Field Paint Only Policy \\u2013 see number 24\", \"publisher\": \"EMR Paintball\", \"accessdate\": \"February 16, 2010\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20100324143022/http://www.emrpaintball.com/fpo.shtml\", \"archivedate\": \"March 24, 2010\"}{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.gatsplat.com/fpo.asp\", \"title\": \"FPO?

So, fields that must wash paintball paint into municipal wastewater facilities, or that have substantial rain runoff into bodies of water that are used as sources of drinking water, are generally required by the municipality to restrict players to only certain paint formulations; the easiest way to achieve this is to sell only approved paint and require that field paint be used.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.gatsplat.com/fpo.asp\", \"title\": \"Field Paint Only policy and explanation at GatSplat in Lewisville, TX, an indoor paintball facility\", \"publisher\": \"Gatsplat.com\", \"accessdate\": \"July 11, 2012\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20120718174251/http://www.gatsplat.com/fpo.asp\", \"archivedate\": \"July 18, 2012\"}\nPlaying on a non-established field is sometimes referred to as renegade or gonzo play or outlaw ball (with the players nicknamed renegade ballers or outlaws).{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.redorbit.com/news/health/125655/splat__south_sound_plays_host_to_some_of_the/\", \"title\": \"SPLAT! ; South Sound Plays Host to Some of the Best in the World of Paintball\", \"publisher\": \"News Tribune, The\", \"accessdate\": \"September 15, 2009\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20110715171911/http://www.redorbit.com/news/health/125655/splat__south_sound_plays_host_to_some_of_the/\", \"archivedate\": \"July 15, 2011\"} Though less expensive and less structured than play at a commercial facility, the lack of safety protocols, instruction, and oversight can lead to higher incidence of injuries.\n\nOrganized play\nThe first organized paintball game in record was held by Charles Gaines and his friends in New Hampshire in 1981, with the first paintball field opening approximately a year later in Sutton, New Hampshire.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://68caliber.com/?p=7721\", \"title\": \"Paintball History Sites\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://archive.is/20120710053725/http://68caliber.com/?p=7721\", \"archivedate\": \"2012-07-10\"}{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.bbc.com/news/av/stories-46033159/i-invented-paintball-to-settle-an-argument\", \"title\": \"'I shot him right in the butt': I invented paintball\", \"website\": \"BBC News\", \"language\": \"en-GB\", \"accessdate\": \"2018-11-02\"} In 1983, the first National Survival Game (NSG) championship was held, with a $14,000 cash award for the winning team.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.paintball-tips-and-tricks.com/history-of-paintball.html\", \"title\": \"The True History Of Paintball\", \"accessdate\": \"February 17, 2010\"} As of 2010[update], tournaments are largely organized by paintball leagues.\n\nLeagues\nA Speedball league is an organization that provides a regulated competition for Speedball players to compete.

Two teams face off at a set time and play only one game per game day in the season as beginners play a 24-minute game and amateur and professionals play a 32-minute game, both requiring 90 minutes to resolve.\nA match in a tournament is refereed by a judge, whose authority and decisions are final. Tournament rules can vary as specified by the league, but may include for example \u2013 not allowing players to use devices to communicate with other persons during a game, or not allowing players to unduly alter the layout of terrain on the field. In contrast to a casual game designed for fun, a tournament is much stricter and violations of rules may result in penalties for the players or entire teams.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.pspevents.com/uploads/PSP2009RulesGeneral.pdf\", \"title\": \"PSP Point Rules\", \"date\": \"February 12, 2009\", \"publisher\": \"PSP Events\", \"accessdate\": \"February 18, 2010\"}\nThough tournament paintball was originally played in the woods, speedball became the standard competitive format in the 1990s.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.citypaper.com/columns/story.asp?id=13664\", \"title\": \"In The Paint\", \"date\": \"May 23, 2007\", \"accessdate\": \"December 23, 2009\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20110814162308/http://www2.citypaper.com/columns/story.asp?id=13664\", \"archivedate\": \"August 14, 2011\", \"author\": \"Alvania, Rebecca\"}{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://68caliber.com/?p=5940\", \"title\": \"National Pump League Goes Back To Paintball's Roots\", \"date\": \"February 2, 2010\", \"publisher\": \".68caliber\", \"accessdate\": \"February 17, 2010\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://archive.is/20120709124030/http://68caliber.com/?p=5940\", \"archivedate\": \"July 9, 2012\"} The smaller fields made use of artificial terrain such as bunkers, allowing symmetrical fields that eliminate terrain advantages for either team; woodsball fields having no such guarantee.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=pdQNAAAAIBAJ&sjid=WngDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6610,2199580&dq=paintball+tournament+symmetrical&hl=en\", \"title\": \"Styles of play\", \"date\": \"May 18, 2006\", \"publisher\": \"St Petersburg Times\", \"accessdate\": \"February 17, 2010\"} Most recently, fields using inflatable bunkers, tethered to the ground with stakes, have become standard for most tournament formats; the soft, yielding bunkers reduce the occurrence of injuries, the bunkers deflate to store in a compact space and anchor to the ground with tent stakes, allowing for temporary fields to be set up and torn down with less impact on the ground underneath, and the arrangement of bunkers can be easily re-configured to maintain novelty of play or to simulate a predetermined field layout for an upcoming event.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.paintball-tips-and-tricks.com/airball.html\", \"title\": \"Information on Airball\", \"publisher\": \"Paintball-tips-and-tricks.com\", \"accessdate\": \"September 13, 2010\"}\n\nProfessional teams\nA professional paintball team is one that plays paintball with the financial, equipment or other kind of support of one or more sponsors, often in return for advertising rights.
