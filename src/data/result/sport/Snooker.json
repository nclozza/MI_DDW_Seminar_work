It is played on a rectangular table covered with a green cloth (or \"baize\"), with pockets at each of the four corners and in the middle of each long side. Using a cue stick and 21 coloured balls, players must strike the white ball (or \"cue ball\") to pot or pocket the remaining balls in the correct sequence, accumulating points for each pot. An individual game (or frame), is won by the player scoring the most points. A match is won when a player wins a predetermined number of frames.\nSnooker gained its identity in 1875 when army officer Sir Neville Chamberlain (1856\u20131944), stationed in Ooty, Tamil Nadu, devised a set of rules that combined pyramid and black pool. The word snooker was a long-used military term for inexperienced or first-year personnel. The game grew in popularity in the United Kingdom, and the Billiards Association and Control Club was formed in 1919. It is now governed by the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA).\nThe World Snooker Championship has taken place since 1927. Joe Davis, a key figure and pioneer in the early growth of the sport, won the championship 15 straight times between 1927 and 1946. The \"modern era\" began in 1969 after the broadcaster BBC commissioned the snooker television show Pot Black and later began to air the World Championship in 1978. Key figures in the game were Ray Reardon in the 1970s, Steve Davis in the 1980s, and Stephen Hendry in the 1990s, each winning six or more World championships. Since 2000, Ronnie O'Sullivan has won the most world titles, with five. Top professional players now compete regularly around the world and earn millions of pounds on the World Snooker Tour, which features players from across the world.\n\nHistory\nThe origin of snooker dates back to the latter half of the 19th century.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/sporting-vernacular-11-snooker-1089731.html\", \"title\": \"Sporting Vernacular 11.

At the start of a frame, the balls are positioned as shown in the first image, and the players then take turns hitting shots by striking the cue ball with the tip of the cue, their aim being to pot one of the red balls into a pocket and thereby score a point. Failure to make contact with the red ball constitutes a foul shot.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.wpbsa.com/sites/default/files/uploads/official_rules_edited_05.11.14_web_version_1.pdf\", \"title\": \"Official Rules of the Games of Snooker and English Billiards\", \"date\": \"November 2014\", \"publisher\": \"[[World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association|The World Professional Billiards & Snooker Association Limited]]\", \"accessdate\": \"23 April 2016\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20160304084316/http://www.wpbsa.com/sites/default/files/uploads/official_rules_edited_05.11.14_web_version_1.pdf\", \"archivedate\": \"4 March 2016\"} If the striker pots a red ball, he or she must then pot one of the six \"colours\".[c] If the player successfully pots a colour, the value of that ball is added to the player's score, and the ball is returned to its starting position on the table. After that, the player must pot another red ball, then another colour, in sequence.

The total number of consecutive points (excluding fouls) that a player amasses during one visit to the table is known as a break. A player attaining a break of 15, for example, could have reached it by potting a red then a black, then a red then a pink, before failing to pot the next red. A maximum break in snooker is achieved by potting all reds with blacks then all colours, yielding 147 points; this is often known as a \"147\" or just as a \"maximum\".{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"14 January 2007\", \"title\": \"Ding compiles maximum at Masters\", \"url\": \"http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/snooker/6260923.stm\", \"work\": \"news.bbc.co.uk\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20070207225605/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/snooker/6260923.stm\", \"archivedate\": \"7 February 2007\", \"accessdate\": \"31 January 2019\"}\nPoints may also be scored in a game when a player's opponent fouls. A foul can occur for various reasons, most commonly for failing to hit the correct ball (e.g. hitting a colour first when the player was attempting to hit a red), or for sending the cue ball into a pocket. The former may occur when the player fails to escape from a \"snooker\"\u00a0\u2013 a situation in which the previous player leaves the cue ball positioned such that no legal ball can be struck directly without obstruction by an illegal ball. Points gained from a foul vary from a minimum of four to a maximum of seven if the black ball is involved.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.wpbsa.com/sites/default/files/uploads/official_rules_edited_05.11.14_web_version_1.pdf\", \"title\": \"Official Rules of the Games of Snooker and English Billiards\", \"date\": \"November 2014\", \"publisher\": \"[[World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association|The World Professional Billiards & Snooker Association Limited]]\", \"accessdate\": \"23 April 2016\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20160304084316/http://www.wpbsa.com/sites/default/files/uploads/official_rules_edited_05.11.14_web_version_1.pdf\", \"archivedate\": \"4 March 2016\"}\nA foul shot that leaves no valid shot for the opponent can leave them a free ball. A free ball allows a player to use any other coloured ball in place of the shot they were supposed to play. Doing so with all 15 red balls in play can result in a break exceeding a maximum, with the highest possible being a 155 break, achieved via the opponent leaving a free ball, with the black being potted as the additional colour, and then potting 15 reds and blacks with the colours.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.wpbsa.com/sites/default/files/uploads/official_rules_edited_05.11.14_web_version_1.pdf\", \"title\": \"Official Rules of the Games of Snooker and English Billiards\", \"date\": \"November 2014\", \"publisher\": \"[[World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association|The World Professional Billiards & Snooker Association Limited]]\", \"accessdate\": \"23 April 2016\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20160304084316/http://www.wpbsa.com/sites/default/files/uploads/official_rules_edited_05.11.14_web_version_1.pdf\", \"archivedate\": \"4 March 2016\"} Jamie Cope has the distinction of being the first player in snooker history to post a verified 155 break, achieved in a practice frame in 2005, with other players such as Alex Higgins also claiming to have made a similar break.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"title\": \"Alex Higgins: A 155 break impossible?

The cloth is often called \"baize\"; although true baize is a lower quality cloth sometimes used on pool tables. The nap will affect the direction of the cue ball depending on which direction the cue ball is shot and also on whether left or right side (spin) is placed on the ball. Even if the cue ball is hit in exactly the same way, the nap will cause a different effect depending on whether the ball is hit down table (towards the black ball spot) or up table (towards the baulk line). The cloth on a snooker table is not vacuumed, as this can destroy the nap. The cloth is brushed in a straight line from the baulk end to the far end with multiple brush strokes that are straight in direction (i.e. not across the table). Some table men will also then drag a dampened cloth wrapped around a short piece of board (like a two by four), or straight back of a brush to collect any remaining fine dust and help lay the nap down.
