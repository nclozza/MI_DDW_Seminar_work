This, combined with sexual squeamishness towards the public fisting culture in gay establishments of San Francisco, led gay writer Randy Shilts to successfully campaign for the closure of venues, such as gay bathhouses and sex clubs, that openly permitted it.[9] Fisting gradually returned as a sexual practice over the next 30 years.\nThe San Francisco South of Market Leather History Alley consists of four works of art along Ringold Alley honoring leather culture; it opened in 2017.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.artandarchitecture-sf.com/ringold-alleys-leather-memoir.html\", \"title\": \"Reginold Alley's Leather Memoir\", \"date\": \"July 17, 2017\", \"website\": \"Public Art and Architecture from Around the World\", \"publisher\": \"Art and Architecture\", \"accessdate\": \"July 7, 2018\", \"author\": \"Cindy\"}{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.jweekly.com/2018/06/21/honoring-gay-leather-culture-with-art-installation-in-soma-alleyway/\", \"title\": \"Honoring gay leather culture with art installation in SoMa alleyway \\u2013 J\", \"last\": \"Paull\", \"first\": \"Laura\", \"date\": \"June 21, 2018\", \"publisher\": \"Jweekly.com\", \"accessdate\": \"June 23, 2018\"} One of the works of art is metal bootprints along the curb which honor 28 people who were an important part of the leather communities of San Francisco; those honored include Steve McEachern, owner of the fisting club the Catacombs, and Bert Herman, leader of the fisting community, author, and publisher.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.artandarchitecture-sf.com/ringold-alleys-leather-memoir.html\", \"title\": \"Reginold Alley's Leather Memoir\", \"date\": \"July 17, 2017\", \"website\": \"Public Art and Architecture from Around the World\", \"publisher\": \"Art and Architecture\", \"accessdate\": \"July 7, 2018\", \"author\": \"Cindy\"}{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.jweekly.com/2018/06/21/honoring-gay-leather-culture-with-art-installation-in-soma-alleyway/\", \"title\": \"Honoring gay leather culture with art installation in SoMa alleyway \\u2013 J\", \"last\": \"Paull\", \"first\": \"Laura\", \"date\": \"June 21, 2018\", \"publisher\": \"Jweekly.com\", \"accessdate\": \"June 23, 2018\"}\n\nTechniques\nThe \"Silent Duck\", also called \"Duck-Billing\", is the technique often used in which the person engaging in hand insertion shapes the hand to resemble a duck's beak. Typically, fisting does not involve forcing the clenched fist into the vagina or rectum; this is a practice called \"punching\". Instead, all five fingers are kept straight and held as close together as possible (forming the beak-like \"duck\"), then slowly inserted into a well lubricated vagina or rectum.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"1991\", \"title\": \"Trust\\u2014the Hand Book: A Guide to the Sensual and Spiritual Art of Handballing\", \"url\": \"https://books.google.com/books?id=o1ZvK2UC4FQC\", \"location\": \"San Francisco\", \"publisher\": \"Alamo Square Press\", \"pages\": \"46\\u201347, 58\", \"isbn\": \"978-0-9624751-5-3\", \"accessdate\": \"March 4, 2014\", \"last\": \"Herrman\", \"first\": \"Bert\"}\nIn more vigorous forms of fisting, such as \"punching\" or \"punchfisting\", a fully clenched fist may be inserted and withdrawn slowly.\nFistees who are more experienced may take two fists (double-fisting). In the case of double-fisting, pleasure is derived more from the stretching of the anus or vagina than from the thrusting (in-and-out) movement of hands.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"1991\", \"title\": \"Trust\\u2014the Hand Book: A Guide to the Sensual and Spiritual Art of Handballing\", \"url\": \"https://books.google.com/books?id=o1ZvK2UC4FQC\", \"location\": \"San Francisco\", \"publisher\": \"Alamo Square Press\", \"pages\": \"46\\u201347, 58\", \"isbn\": \"978-0-9624751-5-3\", \"accessdate\": \"March 4, 2014\", \"last\": \"Herrman\", \"first\": \"Bert\"}\n\nRisks\nFisting can cause laceration or perforation of the vagina, perineum, rectum, or colon, resulting in serious injury{\"citetype\": \"journal\", \"last2\": \"Giles\", \"first2\": \"A.\", \"last3\": \"Nelson\", \"first3\": \"M.\", \"date\": \"2004\", \"title\": \"Sexual trauma associated with fisting and recreational drugs\", \"journal\": \"[[Sexually Transmitted Infections (journal)|Sexually Transmitted Infections]]\", \"volume\": \"80\", \"issue\": \"6\", \"pages\": \"469\\u2013470\", \"doi\": \"10.1136/sti.2004.011171\", \"pmc\": \"1744939\", \"pmid\": \"15572616\", \"last\": \"Cohen\", \"first\": \"C.
