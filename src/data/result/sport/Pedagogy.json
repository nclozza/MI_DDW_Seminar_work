{"url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedagogy", "content": "Pedagogy\nPedagogy (/\u02c8p\u025bd\u0259\u0261\u0252d\u0292i, -\u0261o\u028ad\u0292i, -\u0261\u0252\u0261i/), most commonly understood as the approach to teaching, refers to the theory and practice of learning, and how this process influences, and is influenced by, the social, political and psychological development of learners. Pedagogy, taken as an academic discipline, is the study of how knowledge and skills are imparted in an educational context, and it considers the interactions that take place during learning. Both the theory and practice of pedagogy vary greatly, as they reflect different social, political, and cultural contexts.[1]\nPedagogy is often described as the act of teaching.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pedagogy\", \"title\": \"Definition of PEDAGOGY\", \"website\": \"www.merriam-webster.com\", \"language\": \"en\"} The pedagogy adopted by teachers shapes their actions, judgments, and other teaching strategies by taking into consideration theories of learning, understandings of students and their needs, and the backgrounds and interests of individual students.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.education.vic.gov.au/Documents/school/teachers/support/learnteachbgpaper.pdf\", \"title\": \"Blueprint for government schools.

Conventional western pedagogies view the teacher as knowledge holder and student as the recipient of knowledge (described by Paulo Freire as \"banking methods\"[5]), but theories of pedagogy increasingly identify the student as an agent and the teacher as a facilitator.\nInstructive strategies are governed by the pupil's background knowledge and experience, situation, and environment, as well as learning goals set by the student and teacher. One example would be the Socratic method.[6]\nThe teaching of adults, as a specific group, is referred to as andragogy.\n\nEtymology and pronunciation\nThe word is a derivative of the Greek \u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03b1\u03b3\u03c9\u03b3\u03af\u03b1 (paidag\u014dgia), from \u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03b1\u03b3\u03c9\u03b3\u03cc\u03c2 (paidag\u014dgos), itself a synthesis of \u1f04\u03b3\u03c9 (\u00e1g\u014d),  \"I lead\", and \u03c0\u03b1\u1fd6\u03c2 (pa\u00eds, genitive \u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03cc\u03c2, paidos) \"boy, child\": hence, \"attendence on boys, to lead a child\".[7] It is pronounced variously, as /\u02c8p\u025bd\u0259\u0261\u0252d\u0292i/, /\u02c8p\u025bd\u0259\u0261o\u028ad\u0292i/, or /\u02c8p\u025bd\u0259\u0261\u0252\u0261i/.[8]{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/pedagogy?q=pedagogy\", \"title\": \"pedagogy noun \\u2013 definition in British English Dictionary & Thesaurus \\u2013 Cambridge Dictionary Online\", \"date\": \"10 October 2012\", \"publisher\": \"Dictionary.cambridge.org\"} Negative connotations of pedantry have sometimes been intended, or taken, at least from the time of Samuel Pepys in the 1650s.[10]\n\nSocrates\nSocrates (470 \u2013 399 BCE) employed the Socratic Method while engaging with a student or peer. This style does not impart knowledge, but rather tries to strengthen the logic of the student by revealing the conclusions of the statement of the student as erroneous or supported. It was first described by Plato in the Socratic Dialogues.\n\nPlato\nPlato (428/427 or 424/423 \u2013 348/347 BCE) describes a system of education in The Republic (375 BCE) in which individual and family rights are sacrificed to the State. He describes three castes: one to learn a trade; one to learn literary and aesthetic ideas; and one to be trained in literary, aesthetic, scientific, and philosophical ideas.[11] Plato saw education as a fulfillment of the soul, and by fulfilling the soul the body subsequently benefited. Plato viewed physical education for all as a necessity to a stable society.[11]\n\nAristotle\nAristotle (384\u2013322 BCE) composed a treatise, On Education, which was subsequently lost. However, he renounced Plato's view in subsequent works, advocating for a common education mandated to all citizens by the State. A small minority of people residing within Greek city-states at this time were considered citizens, and thus Aristotle still limited education to a minority within Greece. Aristotle advocates physical education should precede intellectual studies.[11]\n\nQuintilian\nMarcus Fabius Quintilianus (35 \u2013 100 CE) published his pedagogy in Institutio Oratoria (95 CE). He describes education as a gradual affair, and places certain responsibilities on the teacher. He advocates for rhetorical, grammatical, scientific, and philosophical education.[11]\n\nTertullian\nQuintus Septimius Florens Tertullianus (155 - 240 CE) was a Christian scholar who rejected all pagan education, insisting this was \"a road to the false and arrogant wisdom of ancient philosophers\".[11]\n\nJerome\nSaint Jerome (347 - 30 September 420 CE), or Saint Hieronymus, was a Christian scholar who detailed his pedagogy of girls in numerous letters throughout his life. He did not believe the body in need of training, and thus advocated for fasting and mortification to subdue the body.[11] He only recommends the Bible as reading material, with limited exposure, and cautions against musical instruments. He advocates against letting girls interact with society, and of having \"affections for one of her companions than for others.\"[11] He does recommend teaching the alphabet by ivory blocks instead of memorization so \"She will thus learn by playing.\"[11] He is an advocate of positive reinforcement, stating \"Do not chide her for the difficulty she may have in learning. On the contrary, encourage her by commendation...\"[11]\n\nGerson\nJean Charlier de Gerson (13 December 1363 \u2013 12 July 1429), the Chancellor of the University of Paris, wrote in De parvulis ad Christum trahendis \"Little children are more easily managed by caresses than fear,\" supporting a more gentle approach than his Christian predecessors. He also states \"Above all else, let the teacher make an effort to be a father to his pupils.\" He is considered a precursor of Fenelon.[11]\n\nJohann Pestalozzi\nJohann Heinrich Pestalozzi (January 12, 1746 \u2013 February 17, 1827) founder of several educational institutions both in German - and French-speaking regions of Switzerland and wrote many works explaining his revolutionary modern principles of education. His motto was \"Learning by head, hand and heart\".[12]\n\nJohann Herbart\nThe educational philosophy and pedagogy of Johann Friedrich Herbart (4 May 1776 - 14 August 1841) highlighted the correlation between personal development and the resulting benefits to society. In other words, Herbart proposed that humans become fulfilled once they establish themselves as productive citizens. Herbartianism refers to the movement underpinned by Herbart's theoretical perspectives.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"title \": \"Herbartianism {{!}} education\", \"url \": \"http://www.britannica.com/topic/Herbartianism\", \"website \": \"Encyclop\\u00e6dia Britannica\"} Referring to the teaching process, Herbart suggested five steps as crucial components. Specifically, these five steps include: preparation, presentation, association, generalization, and application.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"title \": \"Johann Friedrich Herbart {{!}} biography \\u2013 German educator\", \"url \": \"http://www.britannica.com/biography/Johann-Friedrich-Herbart\", \"website \": \"Encyclop\\u00e6dia Britannica\"} Herbart suggests that pedagogy relates to having assumptions as an educator and a specific set of abilities with a deliberate end goal in mind.{\"citetype\": \"journal\", \"title \": \"Educational Theory as Topological Rhetoric: The Concepts of Pedagogy of Johann Friedrich Herbart and Friedrich Schleiermacher\", \"journal \": \"Studies in Philosophy and Education\", \"date \": \"12 February 2012\", \"issn \": \"0039-3746\", \"pages \": \"265\\u2013273\", \"volume \": \"31\", \"issue \": \"3\", \"doi \": \"10.1007/s11217-012-9287-6\", \"first \": \"Karsten\"}\n\nJohn Dewey\nThe pedagogy of John Dewey (20 October 1859 \u2013 1 June 1952) is presented in several works, including My Pedagogic Creed (1897), The School and Society (1900), The Child and the Curriculum (1902), Democracy and Education (1916), Schools of To-morrow (1915) with Evelyn Dewey, and Experience and Education (1938). In his eyes, the purpose of education should not revolve around the acquisition of a pre-determined set of skills, but rather the realization of one's full potential and the ability to use those skills for the greater good (My Pedagogic Creed, Dewey, 1897). Dewey advocated for an educational structure that strikes a balance between delivering knowledge while also taking into account the interests and experiences of the student (The Child and the Curriculum, Dewey, 1902). Dewey not only re-imagined the way that the learning process should take place but also the role that the teacher should play within that process. He envisioned a divergence from the mastery of a pre-selected set of skills to the cultivation of autonomy and critical-thinking within the teacher and student alike.\n\nConfucius\nConfucius (551\u2013479 BCE) stated that authority has the responsibility to provide oral and written instruction to the people under the rule, and \"should do them good in every possible way.\"[11] One of the deepest teachings of Confucius may have been the superiority of personal exemplification over explicit rules of behavior. His moral teachings emphasized self-cultivation, emulation of moral exemplars, and the attainment of skilled judgment rather than knowledge of rules.\n\nHidden curriculum\nA hidden curriculum is a side effect of an education, \"[lessons] which are learned but not openly intended\"[16] such as the transmission of norms, values, and beliefs conveyed in the classroom and the social environment.[17]\n\nLearning space\nLearning space or learning setting refers to a physical setting for a learning environment, a place in which teaching and learning occur.{\"citetype\": \"journal\", \"year\": \"2010\", \"title\": \"Learning Setting-Generalized Activity Models for Smart Spaces\", \"journal\": \"IEEE Intell Syst\", \"volume\": \"2010\", \"issue\": \"99\", \"page\": \"1\", \"doi\": \"10.1109/MIS.2010.112\", \"pmc\": \"3068197\", \"pmid\": \"21461133\", \"last1 \": \"Cook\"} The term is commonly used as a more definitive alternative to \"classroom,\"[19] but it may also refer to an indoor or outdoor location, either actual or virtual.  Learning spaces are highly diverse in use, learning styles, configuration, location, and educational institution. They support a variety of pedagogies, including quiet study, passive or active learning, kinesthetic or physical learning, vocational learning, experiential learning, and others.\n\nLearning theories\nLearning theories are conceptual frameworks describing how knowledge is absorbed, processed, and retained during learning. Cognitive, emotional, and environmental influences, as well as prior experience, all play a part in how understanding, or a world view, is acquired or changed and knowledge and skills retained.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"last \": \"Illeris\", \"first \": \"Knud\", \"title \": \"The three dimensions of learning\", \"publisher \": \"Krieger Pub.

Key adaptations in teaching resource include:[27]\nClassroom constraints\nCultural familiarity\nLocal relevance\nInclusivity for diverse students\n\nCritical pedagogy\nCritical pedagogy is both a pedagogical approach and a broader social movement. Critical pedagogy acknowledges that educational practices are contested and shaped by history, schools are not politically neutral spaces and teaching are political. Decisions regarding the curriculum, disciplinary practices, student testing, textbook selection, the language used by the teacher, and more can empower or disempower students. It recognizes that educational practices favor some students over others and some practices harm all students. It also recognizes that educational practices often favor some voices and perspectives while marginalizing or ignoring others. Another aspect examined is the power the teacher holds over students and the implications of this. Its aims include empowering students to become active and engaged citizens, who are able to actively improve their own lives and their communities.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"2008\", \"title\": \"Critical Pedagogy Primer\", \"publisher\": \"Peter Lang\", \"isbn\": \"9781433101823\", \"last\": \"Kincheloe\", \"first\": \"Joe\"}\nCritical pedagogical practices may include, listening to and including students' knowledge and perspectives in class, making connections between school and the broader community, and posing problems to students that encourage them to question assumed knowledge and understandings. The goal of problem posing to students is to enable them to begin to pose their own problems. Teachers acknowledge their position of authority and exhibit this authority through their actions that support students.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"2008\", \"title\": \"Critical Pedagogy Primer\", \"publisher\": \"Peter Lang\", \"isbn\": \"9781433101823\", \"last\": \"Kincheloe\", \"first\": \"Joe\"}\n\nDialogic learning\nDialogic learning is learning that takes place through dialogue. It is typically the result of egalitarian dialogue; in other words, the consequence of a dialogue in which different people provide arguments based on validity claims and not on power claims.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"editor1last\": \"Kincheloe\", \"editor1first\": \"Joe L.\", \"title\": \"The Praeger Handbook of Education and Psychology\", \"url\": \"https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0313331235\", \"page\": \"552\", \"isbn\": \"978-0313331237\", \"editor2first\": \"Raymond A.\", \"editor2last\": \"Horn\"}\n\nStudent-centered learning\nStudent-centered learning, also known as learner-centered education, broadly encompasses methods of teaching that shift the focus of instruction from the teacher to the student. In original usage, student-centered learning aims to develop learner autonomy and independence[30] by putting responsibility for the learning path in the hands of students.[31][32][33] Student-centered instruction focuses on skills and practices that enable lifelong learning and independent problem-solving.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"last1\": \"Young\", \"first1\": \"Lynne E.\", \"last2\": \"Paterson\", \"first2\": \"Barbara L.\", \"title\": \"Teaching Nursing: Developing a Student-centered Learning Environment\", \"url\": \"https://books.google.com/books?isbn=078175772X\", \"page\": \"5\", \"isbn\": \"978-0781757720\"}\n\nAcademic degrees\nThe academic degree Ped. D., Doctor of Pedagogy, is awarded honorarily by some US universities to distinguished teachers (in the US and UK, earned degrees within the instructive field are classified as an Ed. D., Doctor of Education, or a Ph.D., Doctor of Philosophy). The term is also used to denote an emphasis in education as a specialty in a field (for instance, a Doctor of Music degree in piano pedagogy).\n\nPedagogues in Europe\nThe education of pedagogues, and their role in society, varies greatly from culture to culture.\n\nDenmark\nIn Scandinavia, a pedagogue (p\u00e6dagog) is broadly speaking a practitioner of pedagogy, but the term is primarily reserved for individuals who occupy jobs in pre-school education (such as kindergartens and nurseries). A pedagogue can occupy various kinds of jobs, within this restrictive definition, e.g. in retirement homes, prisons, orphanages, and human resource management. When working with at-risk families or youths they are referred to as social pedagogues (socialp\u00e6dagog).\nThe pedagogue's job is usually distinguished from a teacher's by primarily focusing on teaching children life-preparing knowledge such as social or non-curriculum skills, and cultural norms. There is also a very big focus on the care and well-being of the child. Many pedagogical institutions also practice social inclusion. The pedagogue's work also consists of supporting the child in their mental and social development.[35]\nIn Denmark all pedagogues are educated at a series of national institutes for social educators located all major cities. The education is a 3.5-year academic course, giving the student the title of a Bachelor in Social Education (Danish: Professionsbachelor som p\u00e6dagog).{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.via.dk/uddannelser/paedagogik-og-laering/paedagog\", \"title\": \"P\\u00e6dagog\", \"website\": \"UddannelsesGuiden\", \"publisher\": \"[[Ministry of Children and Education (Denmark)|Ministry of Children and Education]]\", \"language\": \"Danish\", \"transtitle\": \"Pedagogue\"}[37]\nIt is also possible to earn a master's degree in pedagogy/educational science from the University of Copenhagen. This BA and MA program has a more theoretical focus compared to the more vocational Bachelor in Social Education.\n\nHungary\nIn Hungary, the word pedagogue (pedag\u00f3gus) is synonymous with the teacher (tan\u00e1r); therefore, teachers of both primary and secondary schools may be referred to as pedagogues, a word that appears also in the name of their lobbyist organizations and labor unions (e.g.  Labor Union of Pedagogues, Democratic Labor Union of Pedagogues{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.pedagogusok.hu/\", \"title\": \"Front Page\", \"publisher\": \"Labor Union of Pedagogues\", \"work\": \"The Official Site of The Labor Union of Pedagogues\"}). However, undergraduate education in Pedagogy does not qualify students to become teachers in primary or secondary schools but makes them able to apply to be educational assistants. As of 2013, the 6-year training period was re-installed in place of the undergraduate and postgraduate division which characterized the previous practice.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"title\": \"Ezekre a tan\\u00e1ri szakokra jelentkeztek a legt\\u00f6bben [English: These Teaching Areas Proved The Most Popular]\", \"url\": \"http://eduline.hu/erettsegi_felveteli/2013/4/19/legnepszerubb_tanari_szakok_2013_7NXQ9F\", \"accessdate\": \"27 May 2013\", \"newspaper\": \"Eduline\"}\n\nModern pedagogy\nAn article from Kathmandu Post published on 3 June 2018 described the usual first day of school in an academic calendar. Teachers meet their students with distinct traits. The diversity of attributions among children or teens exceeds similarities. Educators have to teach students with different cultural, social, and religious backgrounds. This situation entails a differentiated strategy in pedagogy and not the traditional approach for teachers to accomplish goals efficiently.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"title\": \"A new pedagogy\", \"url\": \"https://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/news/2018-06-03/a-new-pedagogy.html\", \"accessdate\": \"8 June 2018\"}\nAmerican author and educator Carol Ann Tomlinson defined Differentiated Instruction as \"teachers' efforts in responding to inconsistencies among students in the classroom.\" Differentiation refers to methods of teaching.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.scholastic.com/teachers/articles/teaching-content/what-differentiated-instruction/\", \"title\": \"What Is Differentiated Instruction? {{!}} Scholastic\", \"website\": \"www.scholastic.com\"} She explained that Differentiated Instruction gives learners a variety of alternatives for acquiring information. Primary principles comprising the structure of Differentiated Instruction include formative and ongoing assessment, group collaboration, recognition of students' diverse levels of knowledge, problem-solving, and choice in reading and writing experiences.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.ascd.org/publications/books/100216/chapters/Understanding-Differentiated-Instruction@-Building-a-Foundation-for-Leadership.aspx\", \"title\": \"Understanding Differentiated Instruction: Building a Foundation for Leadership\", \"last\": \"ASCD\", \"website\": \"www.ascd.org\", \"language\": \"en-US\"}\nHoward Gardner gained prominence in the education sector for his Multiple Intelligences Theory.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.gse.harvard.edu/faculty/howard-gardner\", \"title\": \"Howard Gardner\", \"website\": \"Harvard Graduate School of Education\", \"language\": \"en\"} He named seven of these intelligences in 1983: Linguistic, Logical and Mathematical, Visual and Spatial, Body and Kinesthetic, Musical and Rhythmic, Intrapersonal, and Interpersonal. Critics say the theory is based only on Gardner's intuition instead of empirical data. Another criticism is that the intelligence is too identical for types of personalities.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"17 July 2014\", \"title\": \"Multiple Intelligences Theory (Gardner) \\u2013 Learning Theories\", \"url\": \"https://www.learning-theories.com/gardners-multiple-intelligences-theory.html\", \"work\": \"Learning Theories\", \"accessdate\": \"8 June 2018\"} The theory of Howard Gardner came from cognitive research and states these intelligence help people to \"know the world, understand themselves, and other people.\" Said differences dispute an educational system that presumes students can \"understand the same materials in the same manner and that a standardized, collective measure is very much impartial towards linguistic approaches in instruction and assessment as well as to some extent logical and quantitative styles.\"{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.tecweb.org/styles/gardner.html\", \"title\": \"Gardner's Multiple Intelligences\", \"website\": \"www.tecweb.org\"}\nSources\n\u00a0This article incorporates text from a free content work.
