    "content": "Cockfight\nA cockfight is a blood sport between two cocks, or gamecocks, held in a ring called a cockpit. The history of raising fowl for fighting goes back 6,000 years. The first documented use of the word gamecock, denoting use of the cock as to a \"game\", a sport, pastime or entertainment, was recorded in 1634,[1] after the term \"cock of the game\" used by George Wilson, in the earliest known book on the sport of cockfighting in The Commendation of Cocks and Cock Fighting in 1607. But it was during Magellan's voyage of discovery of the Philippines in 1521 when modern cockfighting was first witnessed and documented by Antonio Pigafetta, Magellan's chronicler, in the kingdom of Taytay.\nThe combatants, referred to as gamecocks (not to be confused with game birds), are specially bred and conditioned for increased stamina and strength. Male and female chickens of such a breed are referred to as game fowl.\nCocks possess congenital aggression toward all males of the same species. Wagers are often made on the outcome of the match.\nCockfighting is a blood sport due in some part to the physical trauma the cocks inflict on each other, which is sometimes increased by attaching metal spurs to the cocks' natural spurs. While not all fights are to the death, the cocks may endure significant physical trauma. In some areas around the world, cockfighting is still practiced as a mainstream event; in some countries it is regulated by law, or forbidden outright.

The cocks fight until ultimately one of them dies or is critically injured. Historically, this was in a cockpit, a term which was also used in the 16th century to mean a place of entertainment or frenzied activity. William Shakespeare used the term in Henry V to specifically mean the area around the stage of a theatre. In Tudor times, the Palace of Westminster had a permanent cockpit, called the Cockpit-in-Court.\n\nHistory\nCockfighting is an ancient spectator sport. There is evidence that cockfighting was a pastime in the Indus Valley Civilization.[5] The Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica (2008) holds:[6]\nThe sport was popular in ancient times in India, China, Persia, and other Eastern countries and was introduced into Ancient Greece in the time of Themistocles (c. 524\u2013460\u00a0BC). For a long time the Romans affected to despise this \"Greek diversion\", but they ended up adopting it so enthusiastically that the agricultural writer Columella (1st century AD) complained that its devotees often spent their whole patrimony in betting at the side of the pit.Based on his analysis of a Mohenjo-daro seal, Iravatham Mahadevan speculates that the city's ancient name could have been Kukkutarma (\"the city [-rma] of the cockerel [kukkuta]\").[7][8] However, according to a recent study,{\"citetype\": \"journal\", \"doi \": \"10.1017/S004393390700147X\", \"title \": \"Overview of chicken taxonomy and domestication\", \"journal \": \"World's Poultry Science Journal\", \"volume \": \"63\", \"issue \": \"2\", \"pages \": \"285\", \"year \": \"2007\", \"last1 \": \"Al-Nasser\", \"first1 \": \"A.\", \"last2 \": \"Al-Khalaifa\", \"first2 \": \"H.\", \"last3 \": \"Al-Saffar\", \"first3 \": \"A.\", \"last4 \": \"Khalil\", \"first4 \": \"F.\", \"last5 \": \"Albahouh\", \"first5 \": \"M.\", \"last6 \": \"Ragheb\", \"first6 \": \"G.\", \"last7 \": \"Al-Haddad\", \"first7 \": \"A.\", \"last8 \": \"Mashaly\"} \"it is not known whether these birds made much contribution to the modern domestic fowl.

A cockspur is a bracelet (often made of leather) with a curved, sharp spike which is attached to the leg of the bird. The spikes typically range in length from \"short spurs\" of just over an inch to \"long spurs\" almost two and a half inches long. In the highest levels of 17th century English cockfighting, the spikes were made of silver. The sharp spurs have been known to injure or even kill the bird handlers.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"2011-02-06\", \"title\": \"Cockfighting bird stabs, kills man\", \"url\": \"http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/rooster_revenge_cockfighting_bird_vdWgYmiTQbLmMBltVoPmxK\", \"work\": \"The New York Post\", \"publisher\": \"Nypost.com\", \"author\": \"Staff\"} In the naked heel variation, the bird's natural spurs are left intact and sharpened: fighting is done without gaffs or taping, particularly in India (especially in Tamil Nadu).

Cockfights are held during the Festival de la Leyenda Vallenata in Valledupar. In August 2010, the Constitutional Court of Colombia rejected a lawsuit that sought to prohibit bullfighting, corralejas and cockfighting with the argument that they constitute animal abuse. In March 2019, the same court confirmed such rule, under the argument that cockfighing and bullfighting are traditions with cultural roots in some municipalities of the country.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.lafm.com.co/colombia/corte-dice-que-corridas-de-toros-y-peleas-de-gallos-son-de-arraigo-cultural\", \"title\": \"Corte dice que corridas de toros y peleas de gallos son de arraigo cultural\", \"last\": \"FM\", \"first\": \"La\", \"date\": \"2019-03-27\", \"website\": \"www.lafm.com.co\", \"language\": \"spanish\"} The Asociaci\u00f3n Nacional de Criadores de Gallos de Pelea organizes an international cockfighting championship.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.semana.com/nacion/articulo/colombia-acoge-campeonato-peleas-gallos/238590-3\", \"title\": \"Colombia acoge campeonato de peleas de gallos\", \"last\": \"Semana\", \"website\": \"Colombia acoge campeonato de peleas de gallos\", \"language\": \"spanish\"}\nCockfighting was immortalized in the novel One Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, in episodes such as the events that led to the death of Prudencio Aguilar,  or the fondness for it by Jos\u00e9 Arcadio Segundo. Cockfighting was one of the main subjects of La Caponera, a TV adaptation of Juan Rulfo's novel, El gallo de oro, aired in Colombia and other countries in the region during the late 90s.\n\nCuba\nIn Cuba, cockfighting is legal and popular, although gambling on matches has been banned since the 1959 Revolution.[24][25] The state has opened official arenas, including a 1,000-seat venue in Ciego de \u00c1vila, but there are also banned underground cockfighting pits.[25]\n\nMexico\nCockfighting is not banned in Mexico, and practiced in the Mexican states of Michoac\u00e1n, Aguascalientes, Jalisco, Sinaloa, and Veracruz, mostly during regional fairs and other celebrations. Cockfights are performed in palenques (pits).[26] Cockfighting remains legal in the municipality of Ixmiquilpan and throughout Mexico.[27]\n\nPeru\nAccording to the Encyclopedia of Latino Culture, Peru \"has probably the longest historical tradition\" with cockfighting, with the practice possibly dating back to the 16th century.[26] Cockfighting is legal and regulated by the government in Peru.

Three- or four-inch blades (Bal in Tulu) are attached to the cocks' legs. Knockout fights to the death are widely practised in Andhra Pradesh. In Tamil Nadu, the winner is decided after three or four rounds. People watch with intense interest surrounding the cocks. The sport has gradually become a gambling sport.\nIn Jharkhand the cockfighting game is known as \"pada\", the spurs are called \"kant\", the cockpit is called \"chhad\", and the person in the cockpit or who ties the spurs is called \"kantkar\".\nIn the Tamil Nadu districts of Chennai, Tanjore, Trichy and Salem, only the 'naked heel' variation is permitted. In Erode, Thiruppur, Karur and Coimbatore districts, only bloody blade fights are conducted. During festival seasons, this is the major game for men. Women normally don't participate. Only the Pure breeds are chosen to the fight.

Cockfighting is a religious obligation at every Balinese temple festival or religious ceremony.[37] Cockfights without a religious purpose are considered gambling in Indonesia, although it is still largely practiced in many parts of Indonesia. Women are generally not involved in the tabuh rah process. The tabuh rah process is held on the largest pavilion in a Balinese temple complex, the wantilan.\nThe American anthropologist Clifford Geertz published his most famous work, Notes on the Balinese Cockfight, on the practice of cockfights in Bali. In it, he argued that the cockfight served as a pastiche or model of wider Balinese society from which judgments about other aspects of the culture could be drawn.\n\nIraq\nCockfighting is illegal but widespread in Iraq. The attendees come to gamble or just for the entertainment. A rooster can cost up to $8,000. The most-prized birds are called Harati, which means that they are of Turkish or Indian origin, and have muscular legs and necks.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.yourmiddleeast.com/news/cockfighting-in-iraq-a-different-kind-of-battle_6031\", \"title\": \"Cockfighting in Iraq: a different kind of battle\", \"date\": \"2012-04-11\", \"publisher\": \"Yourmiddleeast.com\"}\n\nJapan\nCockfighting was introduced to Japan from China in the early 8th century and rose to popularity in the Kamakura period and the Edo period.[39] Cockfighting endured in some Japanese regions even after being banned in 1873,[39] during the Meiji period.[40]\n\nPakistan\nCockfighting is a popular sport in rural Pakistan; however, \"betting is illegal under the Prevention of Gambling Act 1977\".{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2012/01/10/city/islamabad/cockfight-signifies-cruel-culture/\", \"title\": \"Cockfight signifies cruel culture \\u2013 Thursday, 26 July 2012\", \"date\": \"2012-01-09\", \"publisher\": \"Pakistantoday.com.pk\"} Betting is illegal, but police often turn a blind eye towards it.[citation needed] In Sindh (one of 4 major provinces of Pakistan), people are fond of keeping fighting cock breed, known as Sindhi aseel in Pakistan.

In Sindh Gamblor or Khafti uses Almond and other power enhancing medicines to feed the fighter cocks.\n\nPhilippines\nCockfighting, locally termed sabong, is a popular pastime in the Philippines, where both illegal and legal cockfights occur. Legal cockfights are held in cockpits every week, whilst illegal ones, called tupada or tigbakay, are held in secluded cockpits where authorities cannot raid them. In both types, knives or gaffs are used. There are two kinds of knives used in Philippine cockfighting: single-edged blades (used in derbies) and double-edged blades; lengths of knives also vary. All knives are attached on the left leg of the bird, but depending on agreement between owners, blades can be attached on the right or even on both legs. Sabong and illegal tupada, are judged by a referee called sentensyador or koyme, whose verdict is final and not subject to any appeal.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.gmanews.tv/video/25601/Emergency-'Sentensyador'\", \"title\": \"Emergency: 'Sentensyador'\", \"date\": \"2008-07-12\", \"publisher\": \"Gmanews.tv\", \"accessdate\": \"2014-02-11\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20100403020911/http://www.gmanews.tv/video/25601/Emergency-'Sentensyador'\"} Bets are usually taken by the kristo, so named because of his outstretched hands when calling out wagers from the audience and skillfully doing so purely from memory.\nThe country has hosted several World Slasher Cup derbies, held biannually at the Smart Araneta Coliseum, Quezon City, where the world's leading game fowl breeders gather.

The first official known document about cockfighting in Cuba dates from 1737. It is a royal decree asking, to the governor of the island, a report about the inconveniences that might cause cockfights \"with the people from land and sea\" and asking for information about rentals of the games. The Spaniard Miguel Tac\u00f3n, Lieutenant General and governor of the colony, banned cockfighting by a decree dated on October 20, 1835, limiting these spectacles only to holidays.\nIn 1844, a decree dictated by the Captain General of the island, Leopoldo O'Donnell, forbade to non-white people the attendance to these shows. During the second half of the 19th century, many authorizations were conceded for building arenas, until General Juan Rius Rivera, then civilian governor in Havana, prohibited cockfighting by a decree of October 31, 1899, and later the Cuban governor, General Leonard Wood, dictated the military order no. 165 prohibiting cockfights in the whole country since June 1, 1900.[50]\nIn the first half of the 20th century, legality of cockfights suffered several ups and downs.[51]\nIn 1909, the then-Cuban president Jos\u00e9 Miguel G\u00f3mez, with the intention to gain followers, allowed cockfights once again, and then regulations were agreed for the fights.[52]\nUp to the beginning of 1968, cockfights used to be held everywhere in the country, but with the purpose of stopping the bets, the arenas were closed and the fights forbidden by the authorities. In 1980, authorities legalized cockfights again and a state business organization was created with the participation of the private breeders, grouped in territories. Every year the state organization announces several national tournaments from January to April, makes trade shows and sells fighting cocks to clients from other Caribbean countries.[50]\n\nDominican Republic\nIn the Dominican Republic, cockfighting is both legal and very popular. There is at least one arena (gallera) in every town, whereas in bigger cities larger coliseos can be found.  Important fights are broadcast on television and newspapers have dedicated pages to cockfights and the different trabas, the local name for gamefowl breeding grounds. Those dedicated to the breeding and training of fighting cocks are called galleros  or traberos. The cocks are often outfitted with special spurs made from various materials (ranging from plastic to metal or even carey shell)  and fights are typically to the death. Public perception of the sport is as normal as that of baseball or any other major sport.\n\nMexico\nIn Mexico, cockfighting is part of the culture and traditions of most states, the two parties to the bird fights are distinguished through the colors red and green, so it is common to see a scarf or allusive badge hanging on the belt to these colors, in addition to being a business activity where the rooster show and musical shows are both combined. Almost all of the fairs and regional festivals of the country's municipalities are held in venues called \"palenques\" of roosters. These consist of a ring made of wood whose center is full of compacted earth for the best performance of the roosters. In the center, a box 4 meters per side and lines that cross from center to center each side are marked with lime. Finally, the last square, measuring 40 cm on each side, is marked in the center of the arena, where the roosters are taken the third time they are released.
