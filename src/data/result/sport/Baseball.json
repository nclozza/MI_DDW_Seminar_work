    "content": "Baseball\n\n\nBaseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two opposing teams who take turns batting and fielding. The game proceeds when a player on the fielding team, called the pitcher, throws a ball which a player on the batting team tries to hit with a bat. The objective of the offensive team (batting team) is to hit the ball into the field of play, allowing its players to run the bases, having them advance counter-clockwise around four bases to score what are called \"runs\". The objective of the defensive team (fielding team) is to prevent batters from becoming runners, and to prevent runners' advance around the bases.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://mlb.mlb.com/documents/0/4/0/224919040/2017_Official_Baseball_Rules_dbt69t59.pdf\", \"title\": \"Official Rules of MLB, 2017\", \"date\": \"2017\"} A run is scored when a runner legally advances around the bases in order and touches home plate (the place where the player started as a batter). The team that scores the most runs by the end of the game is the winner.\nThe first objective of the batting team is to have a player reach first base safely. A player on the batting team who reaches first base without being called \"out\" can attempt to advance to subsequent bases as a runner, either immediately or during teammates' turns batting. The fielding team tries to prevent runs by getting batters or runners \"out\", which forces them out of the field of play. Both the pitcher and fielders have methods of getting the batting team's players out. The opposing teams switch back and forth between batting and fielding; the batting team's turn to bat is over once the fielding team records three outs. One turn batting for each team constitutes an inning. A game is usually composed of nine innings, and the team with the greater number of runs at the end of the game wins. If scores are tied at the end of nine innings, extra innings are usually played. Baseball has no game clock, although most games end in the ninth inning.\nBaseball evolved from older bat-and-ball games already being played in England by the mid-18th century. This game was brought by immigrants to North America, where the modern version developed. By the late 19th century, baseball was widely recognized as the national sport of the United States. Baseball is popular in North America and parts of Central and South America, the Caribbean, and East Asia, particularly in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.\nIn the United States and Canada, professional Major League Baseball (MLB) teams are divided into the National League (NL) and American League (AL), each with three divisions: East, West, and Central. The MLB champion is determined by playoffs that culminate in the World Series. The top level of play is similarly split in Japan between the Central and Pacific Leagues and in Cuba between the West League and East League. The World Baseball Classic, organized by the World Baseball Softball Confederation, is the major international competition of the sport and attracts the top national teams from around the world.\n\nRules and gameplay\nA baseball game is played between two teams, each composed of nine players, that take turns playing offense (batting and baserunning) and defense (pitching and fielding). A pair of turns, one at bat and one in the field, by each team constitutes an inning. A game consists of nine innings (seven innings at the high school level and in doubleheaders in college and minor leagues, and six innings at the Little League level).{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"title\": \"Rules, Regulations, and Policies - Little League\", \"url\": \"https://www.littleleague.org/playing-rules/rules-regulations-policies/\", \"work\": \"Little League\", \"language\": \"en-US\", \"accessdate\": \"2018-03-19\", \"last\": \"League\", \"first\": \"Little\"} One team\u2014customarily the visiting team\u2014bats in the top, or first half, of every inning. The other team\u2014customarily the home team\u2014bats in the bottom, or second half, of every inning. The goal of the game is to score more points (runs) than the other team. The players on the team at bat attempt to score runs by touching all four bases, in order, set at the corners of the square-shaped baseball diamond. A player bats at home plate and must attempt to safely reach a base before proceeding, counterclockwise, from first base, to second base, third base, and back home to score a run. The team in the field attempts to prevent runs from scoring by recording outs, which remove opposing players from offensive action, until their next turn at bat comes up again. When three outs are recorded, the teams switch roles for the next half-inning. If the score of the game is tied after nine innings, extra innings are played to resolve the contest. Many amateur games, particularly unorganized ones, involve different numbers of players and innings.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/foreword.jsp\", \"title\": \"Official Rules/Foreword\", \"publisher\": \"Major League Baseball\", \"accessdate\": \"2009-02-02\", \"urlstatus\": \"live\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20090124020327/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/foreword.jsp\", \"archivedate\": \"24 January 2009\"}\nThe game is played on a field whose primary boundaries, the foul lines, extend forward from home plate at 45-degree angles. The 90-degree area within the foul lines is referred to as fair territory; the 270-degree area outside them is foul territory. The part of the field enclosed by the bases and several yards beyond them is the infield; the area farther beyond the infield is the outfield. In the middle of the infield is a raised pitcher's mound, with a rectangular rubber plate (the rubber) at its center. The outer boundary of the outfield is typically demarcated by a raised fence, which may be of any material and height. The fair territory between home plate and the outfield boundary is baseball's field of play, though significant events can take place in foul territory, as well.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/01_objectives_of_the_game.pdf\", \"title\": \"Official Rules/1.00\\u2014Objectives of the Game (Rules 1.04\\u20131.07)\", \"publisher\": \"Major League Baseball\", \"accessdate\": \"2009-02-02\", \"urlstatus\": \"live\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20090205011325/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/01_objectives_of_the_game.pdf\", \"archivedate\": \"5 February 2009\"}\nThere are three basic tools of baseball: the ball, the bat, and the glove or mitt:\nProtective helmets are also standard equipment for all batters.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/01_objectives_of_the_game.pdf\", \"title\": \"Official Rules/1.00\\u2014Objectives of the Game (Rule 1.16)\", \"publisher\": \"Major League Baseball\", \"accessdate\": \"2009-02-03\", \"urlstatus\": \"live\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20090205011325/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/01_objectives_of_the_game.pdf\", \"archivedate\": \"February 5, 2009\"}\nAt the beginning of each half-inning, the nine players of the fielding team arrange themselves around the field. One of them, the pitcher, stands on the pitcher's mound. The pitcher begins the pitching delivery with one foot on the rubber, pushing off it to gain velocity when throwing toward home plate. Another fielding team player, the catcher, squats on the far side of home plate, facing the pitcher. The rest of the fielding team faces home plate, typically arranged as four infielders\u2014who set up along or within a few yards outside the imaginary lines (basepaths) between first, second, and third base\u2014and three outfielders. In the standard arrangement, there is a first baseman positioned several steps to the left of first base, a second baseman to the right of second base, a shortstop to the left of second base, and a third baseman to the right of third base. The basic outfield positions are left fielder, center fielder, and right fielder. With the exception of the catcher, all fielders are required to be in fair territory when the pitch is delivered. A neutral umpire sets up behind the catcher.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/09_the_umpire.pdf\", \"title\": \"Official Rules/9.00\\u2014The Umpire (Rule 9.03a)\", \"publisher\": \"Major League Baseball\", \"accessdate\": \"2009-02-03\", \"urlstatus\": \"live\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20090205011323/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/09_the_umpire.pdf\", \"archivedate\": \"February 5, 2009\"} Other umpires will be distributed around the field as well.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"September 29, 2014\", \"title\": \"AP source: 7 umpires rotate at World Series\", \"url\": \"https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2014/09/29/ap-source-7-umpires-rotate-at-world-series/16437053/\", \"agency\": \"Associated Press\", \"accessdate\": \"March 27, 2018\", \"newspaper\": \"USA Today\"}\nPlay starts with a member of the batting team, the batter, standing at home plate, holding a bat.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/05_putting_ball_in_play.pdf\", \"title\": \"Official Rules/5.00\\u2014Putting the Ball in Play.

A batter who hits the ball into the field of play must drop the bat and begin running toward first base, at which point the player is referred to as a runner (or, until the play is over, a batter-runner). A batter-runner who reaches first base without being put out is said to be safe and is on base. A batter-runner may choose to remain at first base or attempt to advance to second base or even beyond\u2014however far the player believes can be reached safely. A player who reaches base despite proper play by the fielders has recorded a hit. A player who reaches first base safely on a hit is credited with a single. If a player makes it to second base safely as a direct result of a hit, it is a double; third base, a triple. If the ball is hit in the air within the foul lines over the entire outfield (and outfield fence, if there is one), or otherwise safely circles all the bases, it is a home run: the batter and any runners on base may all freely circle the bases, each scoring a run. This is the most desirable result for the batter. A player who reaches base due to a fielding mistake is not credited with a hit\u2014instead, the responsible fielder is charged with an error.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/05_putting_ball_in_play.pdf\", \"title\": \"Official Rules/5.00\\u2014Putting the Ball in Play.

A runner on first base must attempt to advance if a ball lands in play. If a ball hit into play rolls foul before passing through the infield, it becomes dead and any runners must return to the base they occupied when the play began. If the ball is hit in the air and caught before it lands, the batter has flied out and any runners on base may attempt to advance only if they tag up (contact the base they occupied when the play began, as or after the ball is caught). Runners may also attempt to advance to the next base while the pitcher is in the process of delivering the ball to home plate; a successful effort is a stolen base.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/05_putting_ball_in_play.pdf\", \"title\": \"Official Rules/5.00\\u2014Putting the Ball in Play.

A batter against whom three strikes are recorded strikes out. A batter against whom four balls are recorded is awarded a base on balls or walk, a free advance to first base. (A batter may also freely advance to first base if the batter's body or uniform is struck by a pitch outside the strike zone, provided the batter does not swing and attempts to avoid being hit.)[15] Crucial to determining balls and strikes is the umpire's judgment as to whether a pitch has passed through the strike zone, a conceptual area above home plate extending from the midpoint between the batter's shoulders and belt down to the hollow of the knee.[16]\nWhile the team at bat is trying to score runs, the team in the field is attempting to record outs. In addition to the strikeout, common ways a member of the batting team may be put out include the flyout, ground out, force out, and tag out. It is possible to record two outs in the course of the same play. This is called a double play. Three outs in one play, a triple play, is possible, though rare. Players put out or retired must leave the field, returning to their team's dugout or bench. A runner may be stranded on base when a third out is recorded against another player on the team. Stranded runners do not benefit the team in its next turn at bat as every half-inning begins with the bases empty.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules//06_the_batter.pdf\", \"title\": \"Official Rules/6.00\\u2014The Batter (Rule 6.05)\", \"publisher\": \"Major League Baseball\", \"accessdate\": \"2009-02-03\", \"urlstatus\": \"live\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20090205011324/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules//06_the_batter.pdf\", \"archivedate\": \"5 February 2009\"}\nAn individual player's turn batting or plate appearance is complete when the player reaches base, hits a home run, makes an out, or hits a ball that results in the team's third out, even if it is recorded against a teammate. On rare occasions, a batter may be at the plate when, without the batter's hitting the ball, a third out is recorded against a teammate\u2014for instance, a runner getting caught stealing (tagged out attempting to steal a base). A batter with this sort of incomplete plate appearance starts off the team's next turn batting; any balls or strikes recorded against the batter the previous inning are erased. A runner may circle the bases only once per plate appearance and thus can score at most a single run per batting turn. Once a player has completed a plate appearance, that player may not bat again until the eight other members of the player's team have all taken their turn at bat in the batting order. The batting order is set before the game begins, and may not be altered except for substitutions. Once a player has been removed for a substitute, that player may not reenter the game. Children's games often have more lenient rules, such as Little League rules, which allow players to be substituted back into the same game.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/03_game_preliminaries.pdf\", \"title\": \"Official Rules/3.00\\u2014Game Preliminaries (Rule 3.03)\", \"publisher\": \"Major League Baseball\", \"accessdate\": \"2009-02-02\", \"urlstatus\": \"live\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20090205011326/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/03_game_preliminaries.pdf\", \"archivedate\": \"5 February 2009\"}{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"title\": \"Rules, Regulations, and Policies - Little League\", \"url\": \"https://www.littleleague.org/playing-rules/rules-regulations-policies/\", \"work\": \"Little League\", \"language\": \"en-US\", \"accessdate\": \"2018-03-19\", \"last\": \"League\", \"first\": \"Little\"}\nIf the designated hitter (DH) rule is in effect, each team has a tenth player whose sole responsibility is to bat (and run). The DH takes the place of another player\u2014almost invariably the pitcher\u2014in the batting order, but does not field. Thus, even with the DH, each team still has a batting order of nine players and a fielding arrangement of nine players.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules//06_the_batter.pdf\", \"title\": \"Official Rules/6.00\\u2014The Batter (Rule 6.10)\", \"publisher\": \"Major League Baseball\", \"accessdate\": \"2009-02-03\", \"urlstatus\": \"live\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20090205011324/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules//06_the_batter.pdf\", \"archivedate\": \"February 5, 2009\"}\n\nPlayers\nThe number of players on a baseball roster, or squad, varies by league and by the level of organized play.

Managers are typically assisted by two or more coaches; they may have specialized responsibilities, such as working with players on hitting, fielding, pitching, or strength and conditioning. At most levels of organized play, two coaches are stationed on the field when the team is at bat: the first base coach and third base coach, whom occupy designated coaches' boxes, just outside the foul lines. These coaches assist in the direction of baserunners, when the ball is in play, and relay tactical signals from the manager to batters and runners, during pauses in play.[26] In contrast to many other team sports, baseball managers and coaches generally wear their team's uniforms; coaches must be in uniform to be allowed on the field to confer with players during a game.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/03_game_preliminaries.pdf\", \"title\": \"Official Rules/3.00\\u2014Game Preliminaries (Rule 3.15)\", \"publisher\": \"Major League Baseball\", \"accessdate\": \"2009-04-27\", \"urlstatus\": \"live\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20090520205621/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/03_game_preliminaries.pdf\", \"archivedate\": \"May 20, 2009\"}\nAny baseball game involves one or more umpires, who make rulings on the outcome of each play. At a minimum, one umpire will stand behind the catcher, to have a good view of the strike zone, and call balls and strikes. Additional umpires may be stationed near the other bases, thus making it easier to judge plays such as attempted force outs and tag outs. In MLB, four umpires are used for each game, one near each base. In the playoffs, six umpires are used: one at each base and two in the outfield along the foul lines.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/09_the_umpire.pdf\", \"title\": \"Official Rules/9.00\\u2014The Umpire\", \"publisher\": \"Major League Baseball\", \"accessdate\": \"2009-02-18\", \"urlstatus\": \"live\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20090224215915/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/09_the_umpire.pdf\", \"archivedate\": \"February 24, 2009\"}\n\nStrategy and tactics\nMany of the pre-game and in-game strategic decisions in baseball revolve around a fundamental fact: in general, right-handed batters tend to be more successful against left-handed pitchers and, to an even greater degree, left-handed batters tend to be more successful against right-handed pitchers.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.newsweek.com/id/146842\", \"title\": \"Southpaw's Revenge\", \"date\": \"July 18, 2008\", \"accessdate\": \"2009-02-08\", \"author\": \"Bast, Andrew\", \"work\": \"[[Newsweek]]\"} A manager with several left-handed batters in the regular lineup, who knows the team will be facing a left-handed starting pitcher, may respond by starting one or more of the right-handed backups on the team's roster.

The manager of the fielding team trying to arrange same-handed pitcher-batter matchups and the manager of the batting team trying to arrange opposite-handed matchups. With a team that has the lead in the late innings, a manager may remove a starting position player\u2014especially one whose turn at bat is not likely to come up again\u2014for a more skillful fielder (known as a defensive substitution).[30]\n\nPitching and fielding tactics\nThe tactical decision that precedes almost every play in a baseball game involves pitch selection.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"August 13, 2015\", \"title\": \"Game Theory Says R.A.

Violation of any one of these rules could result in the umpire calling a balk against the pitcher, which permits any runners on base to advance one base with impunity.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://m.mlb.com/glossary/rules/balk\", \"title\": \"Balk\", \"publisher\": \"Major League Baseball\", \"accessdate\": \"April 23, 2018\"} If an attempted stolen base is anticipated, the catcher may call for a pitchout, a ball thrown deliberately off the plate, allowing the catcher to catch it while standing and throw quickly to a base.[37] Facing a batter with a strong tendency to hit to one side of the field, the fielding team may employ a shift, with most or all of the fielders moving to the left or right of their usual positions. With a runner on third base, the infielders may play in, moving closer to home plate to improve the odds of throwing out the runner on a ground ball, though a sharply hit grounder is more likely to carry through a drawn-in infield.[38]\n\nBatting and baserunning tactics\nSeveral basic offensive tactics come into play with a runner on first base, including the fundamental choice of whether to attempt a steal of second base. The hit and run is sometimes employed, with a skillful contact hitter, the runner takes off with the pitch, drawing the shortstop or second baseman over to second base, creating a gap in the infield for the batter to poke the ball through.[39] The sacrifice bunt, calls for the batter to focus on making soft contact with the ball, so that it rolls a short distance into the infield, allowing the runner to advance into scoring position as the batter is thrown out at first. A batter, particularly one who is a fast runner, may also attempt to bunt for a hit. A sacrifice bunt employed with a runner on third base, aimed at bringing that runner home, is known as a squeeze play.[40] With a runner on third and fewer than two outs, a batter may instead concentrate on hitting a fly ball that, even if it is caught, will be deep enough to allow the runner to tag up and score\u2014a successful batter, in this case, gets credit for a sacrifice fly.[38] The manager will sometimes signal a batter who is ahead in the count (i.e., has more balls than strikes) to take, or not swing at, the next pitch.[41]\n\nHistory\nThe evolution of baseball from older bat-and-ball games is difficult to trace with precision. Consensus once held that today's baseball is a North American development from the older game rounders, popular among children in Great Britain and Ireland.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"2008\", \"title\": \"Baseball: A History of America's Game\", \"edition\": \"3rd\", \"publisher\": \"[[University of Illinois Press]]\", \"isbn\": \"978-0-252-07550-6\", \"oclc\": \"176980876\", \"last\": \"Rader\", \"first\": \"Benjamin G.\"}{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"title\": \"Rounders (English Game)\", \"url\": \"http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/510872/rounders\", \"accessdate\": \"October 23, 2018\", \"encyclopedia\": \"Encyclop\\u00e6dia Britannica\"}{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"February 2, 2015\", \"title\": \"Save rounders!

In 1867, it barred participation by African Americans.[55] The more formally structured National League was founded in 1876.[56] Professional Negro leagues formed, but quickly folded.[57] In 1887, softball, under the name of indoor baseball or indoor-outdoor, was invented as a winter version of the parent game.[58] The National League's first successful counterpart, the American League, which evolved from the minor Western League, was established in 1893, and virtually all of the modern baseball rules were in place by then.[59][60]\nThe National Agreement of 1903 formalized relations both between the two major leagues and between them and the National Association of Professional Base Ball Leagues, representing most of the country's minor professional leagues.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://roadsidephotos.sabr.org/baseball/1903NatAgree.htm\", \"title\": \"National Agreement for the Government of Professional Base Ball Clubs\", \"publisher\": \"roadsidephotos.sabr.org\", \"accessdate\": \"2009-01-29\"} The World Series, pitting the two major league champions against each other, was inaugurated that fall.[62]  The Black Sox Scandal of the 1919 World Series led to the formation of a new National Commission of baseball that drew the two major leagues closer together.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"2003\", \"title\": \"The Business of Baseball\", \"publisher\": \"McFarland\", \"isbn\": \"978-0-7864-1426-0\", \"oclc\": \"50866929\", \"last\": \"Powers\", \"first\": \"Albert Theodore\"} The first major league baseball commissioner, Kenesaw Mountain Landis, was elected in 1920.

Strict new regulations governed the ball's size, shape and composition, along with a new rule officially banning the spitball and other pitches that depended on the ball being treated or roughed-up with foreign substances, resulted in a ball that traveled farther when hit.[66] The rise of the legendary player Babe Ruth, the first great power hitter of the new era, helped permanently alter the nature of the game.[67] In the late 1920s and early 1930s, St. Louis Cardinals general manager Branch Rickey invested in several minor league clubs and developed the first modern farm system.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"2001\", \"title\": \"Never Just a Game: Players, Owners, and American Baseball to 1920\", \"publisher\": \"[[University of North Carolina Press]]\", \"isbn\": \"978-0-8078-4961-3\", \"oclc\": \"28183874\", \"last\": \"Burk\", \"first\": \"Robert F.\"} A new Negro National League was organized in 1933; four years later, it was joined by the Negro American League.

In contrast, baseball has no clock, thus a team cannot win without getting the last batter out and rallies are not constrained by time. At almost any turn in any baseball game, the most advantageous strategy is some form of aggressive strategy.[108] Whereas, in the case of multi-day Test and first-class cricket, the possibility of a draw often encourages a team that is batting last and well behind, to bat defensively and run out the clock, giving up any faint chance at a win, to avoid an overall loss.[109]\nWhile nine innings has been the standard since the beginning of professional baseball, the duration of the average major league game has increased steadily through the years. At the turn of the 20th century, games typically took an hour and a half to play. In the 1920s, they averaged just less than two hours, which eventually ballooned to 2:38 in 1960.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"February 26, 2004\", \"title\": \"Baseball Wants Just a Few More Minutes\", \"url\": \"https://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/columnist/bodley/2004-02-26-bodley_x.htm\", \"work\": \"[[USA Today]]\", \"accessdate\": \"2009-02-03\", \"author\": \"Bodley, Hal\"} By 1997, the average American League game lasted 2:57 (National League games were about 10 minutes shorter\u2014pitchers at the plate making for quicker outs than designated hitters).{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"July 13, 1998\", \"title\": \"Midnight Baseball\", \"url\": \"http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,988721,00.html\", \"work\": \"Time\", \"accessdate\": \"2009-02-03\", \"author\": \"Greenfield, Jeff\", \"authorlink\": \"Jeff Greenfield\"} In 2004, Major League Baseball declared that its goal was an average game of 2:45.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"February 26, 2004\", \"title\": \"Baseball Wants Just a Few More Minutes\", \"url\": \"https://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/columnist/bodley/2004-02-26-bodley_x.htm\", \"work\": \"[[USA Today]]\", \"accessdate\": \"2009-02-03\", \"author\": \"Bodley, Hal\"} By 2014, though, the average MLB game took over three hours to complete.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"September 30, 2014\", \"title\": \"Why Are Baseball Games Getting So Much Longer?\", \"url\": \"http://ftw.usatoday.com/2014/09/mlb-games-length-three-hours-pace-of-play\", \"work\": \"USA Today\", \"accessdate\": \"2014-12-27\", \"author\": \"Berg, Ted\"} The lengthening of games is attributed to longer breaks between half-innings for television commercials, increased offense, more pitching changes, and a slower pace of play with pitchers taking more time between each delivery, and batters stepping out of the box more frequently.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"February 26, 2004\", \"title\": \"Baseball Wants Just a Few More Minutes\", \"url\": \"https://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/columnist/bodley/2004-02-26-bodley_x.htm\", \"work\": \"[[USA Today]]\", \"accessdate\": \"2009-02-03\", \"author\": \"Bodley, Hal\"}{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"July 13, 1998\", \"title\": \"Midnight Baseball\", \"url\": \"http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,988721,00.html\", \"work\": \"Time\", \"accessdate\": \"2009-02-03\", \"author\": \"Greenfield, Jeff\", \"authorlink\": \"Jeff Greenfield\"} Other leagues have experienced similar issues.

In 1915, a baseball instructional manual pointed out that every single pitch, of which there are often more than two hundred in a game, involves an individual, one-on-one contest: \"the pitcher and the batter in a battle of wits\".[115] Pitcher, batter, and fielder all act essentially independent of each other. While coaching staffs can signal pitcher or batter to pursue certain tactics, the execution of the play itself is a series of solitary acts. If the batter hits a line drive, the outfielder is solely responsible for deciding to try to catch it or play it on the bounce and for succeeding or failing. The statistical precision of baseball is both facilitated by this isolation and reinforces it.\nCricket is more similar to baseball than many other team sports in this regard: while the individual focus in cricket is mitigated by the importance of the batting partnership and the practicalities of tandem running, it is enhanced by the fact that a batsman may occupy the wicket for an hour or much more. There is no statistical equivalent in cricket for the fielding error and thus less emphasis on personal responsibility in this area of play.[116]\n\nUniqueness of each baseball park\nUnlike those of most sports, baseball playing fields can vary significantly in size and shape. While the dimensions of the infield are specifically regulated, the only constraint on outfield size and shape for professional teams, following the rules of MLB and Minor League Baseball, is that fields built or remodeled since June 1, 1958, must have a minimum distance of 325 feet (99\u00a0m) from home plate to the fences in left and right field and 400 feet (122\u00a0m) to center.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/01_objectives_of_the_game.pdf\", \"title\": \"Official Rules/1.00\\u2014Objectives of the Game.

For example, at Minute Maid Park, which became the home of the Houston Astros in 2000, the Crawford Boxes in left field are only 315 feet (96\u00a0m) from home plate.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"August 20, 2008\", \"title\": \"No. 8: Out in Left Field in Houston's Crawford Boxes\", \"url\": \"https://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/2008-08-20-bestseats-minutemaid_N.htm\", \"work\": \"USA Today\", \"accessdate\": \"2009-02-17\", \"author\": \"Nightengale, Bob\"} There are no rules at all that address the height of fences or other structures at the edge of the outfield. The most famously idiosyncratic outfield boundary is the left-field wall at Boston's Fenway Park, in use since 1912: the Green Monster is 310 feet (94\u00a0m) from home plate down the line and 37 feet (11\u00a0m) tall.[119]\nSimilarly, there are no regulations at all concerning the dimensions of foul territory. Thus a foul fly ball may be entirely out of play in a park with little space between the foul lines and the stands, but a foulout in a park with more expansive foul ground.[120] A fence in foul territory that is close to the outfield line will tend to direct balls that strike it back toward the fielders, while one that is farther away may actually prompt more collisions, as outfielders run full speed to field balls deep in the corner. These variations can make the difference between a double and a triple or inside-the-park home run.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"May 27, 2006\", \"title\": \"Guerrero Becomes Mr. Inside\", \"url\": \"http://articles.latimes.com/2006/may/27/sports/sp-angels27\", \"work\": \"[[Los Angeles Times]]\", \"accessdate\": \"2009-02-17\", \"author\": \"Shaikin, Bill\"} The surface of the field is also unregulated. While the adjacent image shows a traditional field surfacing arrangement (and the one used by virtually all MLB teams with naturally surfaced fields), teams are free to decide what areas will be grassed or bare.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/01_objectives_of_the_game.pdf\", \"title\": \"Official Rules/1.00\\u2014Objectives of the Game.

Surface variations can have a significant effect on how ground balls behave and are fielded as well as on baserunning. Similarly, the presence of a roof (seven major league teams play in stadiums with permanent or retractable roofs) can greatly affect how fly balls are played.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"October 8, 2002\", \"title\": \"No Fly Ball Routine in Dome\", \"url\": \"http://articles.latimes.com/2002/oct/08/sports/sp-angnote8\", \"work\": \"Los Angeles Times\", \"accessdate\": \"2009-02-17\", \"author\": \"Shaikin, Bill\"} While football and soccer players deal with similar variations of field surface and stadium covering, the size and shape of their fields are much more standardized. The area out-of-bounds on a football or soccer field does not affect play the way foul territory in baseball does, so variations in that regard are largely insignificant.[124]\nThese physical variations create a distinctive set of playing conditions at each ballpark. Other local factors, such as altitude and climate, can also significantly affect play. A given stadium may acquire a reputation as a pitcher's park or a hitter's park, if one or the other discipline notably benefits from its unique mix of elements. The most exceptional park in this regard is Coors Field, home of the Colorado Rockies. Its high altitude\u20145,282 feet (1,610\u00a0m) above sea level\u2014is partly responsible for giving it the strongest hitter's park effect in the major leagues due to the low air pressure.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"2007\", \"title\": \"Baseball Between the Numbers: Why Everything You Know About the Game Is Wrong\", \"publisher\": \"Basic\", \"isbn\": \"978-0-465-00547-5\", \"oclc\": \"77795904\", \"last\": \"Keri\", \"first\": \"Jonah (ed.)\", \"authorlink\": \"Jonah Keri\"} Wrigley Field, home of the Chicago Cubs, is known for its fickle disposition: a hitter's park when the strong winds off Lake Michigan are blowing out, it becomes more of a pitcher's park when they are blowing in.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080930&content_id=3575106\", \"title\": \"Wrigley's Winds Don't Rattle Lowe\", \"date\": \"September 30, 2008\", \"publisher\": \"Major League Baseball\", \"accessdate\": \"2009-02-17\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20081201003317/http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080930&content_id=3575106&vkey=ps2008news&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb\", \"archivedate\": \"December 1, 2008\", \"author\": \"Gilbert, Steve\"} The absence of a standardized field affects not only how particular games play out, but the nature of team rosters and players' statistical records. For example, hitting a fly ball 330 feet (100\u00a0m) into right field might result in an easy catch on the warning track at one park, and a home run at another. A team that plays in a park with a relatively short right field, such as the New York Yankees, will tend to stock its roster with left-handed pull hitters, who can best exploit it. On the individual level, a player who spends most of his career with a team that plays in a hitter's park will gain an advantage in batting statistics over time\u2014even more so if his talents are especially suited to the park.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"March 26, 2008\", \"title\": \"After Move, a Breaking In Process\", \"url\": \"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/24/AR2008032402798.html\", \"work\": \"[[The Washington Post]]\", \"accessdate\": \"2009-02-17\", \"author\": \"Sheinin, Dave\"}\n\nStatistics\nOrganized baseball lends itself to statistics to a greater degree than many other sports. Each play is discrete and has a relatively small number of possible outcomes. In the late 19th century, a former cricket player, English-born Henry Chadwick of Brooklyn, was responsible for the \"development of the box score, tabular standings, the annual baseball guide, the batting average, and most of the common statistics and tables used to describe baseball.\"[128] The statistical record is so central to the game's \"historical essence\" that Chadwick came to be known as Father Baseball.[128] In the 1920s, American newspapers began devoting more and more attention to baseball statistics, initiating what journalist and historian Alan Schwarz describes as a \"tectonic shift in sports, as intrigue that once focused mostly on teams began to go to individual players and their statistics lines.\"{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"2004\", \"title\": \"The Numbers Game: Baseball's Lifelong Fascination with Statistics\", \"publisher\": \"Thomas Dunne\", \"isbn\": \"978-0-312-32222-9\", \"oclc\": \"54692908\", \"last\": \"Schwarz\", \"first\": \"Alan\"}\nThe Official Baseball Rules administered by MLB require the official scorer to categorize each baseball play unambiguously.

For example, statistics can indicate which specific pitchers a certain batter performs best against. If a given situation statistically favors a certain batter, the manager of the fielding team may be more likely to change pitchers or have the pitcher intentionally walk the batter in order to face one who is less likely to succeed.[135]\n\nSabermetrics\nSabermetrics refers to the field of baseball statistical study and the development of new statistics and analytical tools. The term is also used to refer directly to new statistics themselves. The term was coined around 1980 by one of the field's leading proponents, Bill James, and derives from the Society for American Baseball Research (SABR).[136]\nThe growing popularity of sabermetrics since the early 1980s has brought more attention to two batting statistics that sabermetricians argue are much better gauges of a batter's skill than batting average:{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"2007\", \"title\": \"The New Ballgame: Baseball Statistics for the Casual Fan\", \"publisher\": \"ACTA\", \"isbn\": \"978-0-87946-318-2\", \"oclc\": \"123083947\", \"last\": \"Guzzo\", \"first\": \"Glenn\"}\nSome of the new statistics devised by sabermetricians have gained wide use:\n\nPopularity and cultural impact\nWriting in 1919, philosopher Morris Raphael Cohen described baseball as America's national religion.[142] In the words of sports columnist Jayson Stark, baseball has long been \"a unique paragon of American culture\"\u2014a status he sees as devastated by the steroid abuse scandal.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/columns/story?columnist=stark_jayson&id=3892788\", \"title\": \"A-Rod Has Destroyed Game's History\", \"date\": \"February 8, 2009\", \"publisher\": \"[[ESPN.com]]\", \"accessdate\": \"2009-02-08\", \"urlstatus\": \"live\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20090210124048/http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/columns/story?columnist=stark_jayson&id=3892788\", \"archivedate\": \"February 10, 2009\", \"author\": \"Stark, Jayson\"} Baseball has an important place in other national cultures as well: Scholar Peter Bjarkman describes \"how deeply the sport is ingrained in the history and culture of a nation such as Cuba, [and] how thoroughly it was radically reshaped and nativized in Japan.\"[144] Since the early 1980s, the Dominican Republic, in particular the city of San Pedro de Macor\u00eds, has been the major leagues' primary source of foreign talent.[145] In 2017, 83 of the 868 players on MLB Opening Day rosters (and disabled lists) were from the country. Among other Caribbean countries and territories, a combined 97 MLB players were born in Venezuela, Cuba, and Puerto Rico.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.mlb.com/news/opening-day-rosters-feature-230-players-born-outside-the-us/c-116591920\", \"title\": \"Opening Day Rosters Feature 230 Players Born Outside the U.S.\", \"publisher\": \"Major League Baseball\", \"accessdate\": \"April 24, 2018\"} Hall-of-Famer Roberto Clemente remains one of the greatest national heroes in Puerto Rico's history.[147] While baseball has long been the island's primary athletic pastime, its once well-attended professional winter league has declined in popularity since 1990, when young Puerto Rican players began to be included in the major leagues' annual first-year player draft.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"January 16, 2012\", \"title\": \"Puerto Rico Traces Baseball's Slide to the Draft\", \"url\": \"https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/17/sports/baseball/puerto-rico-traces-decline-in-prospects-to-inclusion-in-the-baseball-draft.html\", \"work\": \"The New York Times\", \"accessdate\": \"2012-01-25\", \"author\": \"Castillo, Jorge\"} In Asia, baseball is among the most popular sports in Japan and South Korea.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"March 21, 2017\", \"title\": \"World Baseball Classic keeps sport relevant in Japan\", \"url\": \"http://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-us-japan-hernandez-20170321-story.html\", \"work\": \"Los Angeles Times\", \"accessdate\": \"2018-04-26\", \"author\": \"Hernandez, Dylan\"}\nThe major league game in the United States was originally targeted toward a middle-class, white-collar audience: relative to other spectator pastimes, the National League's set ticket price of 50 cents in 1876 was high, while the location of playing fields outside the inner city and the workweek daytime scheduling of games were also obstacles to a blue-collar audience.[150] A century later, the situation was very different. With the rise in popularity of other team sports with much higher average ticket prices\u2014football, basketball, and hockey\u2014professional baseball had become among the most blue-collar-oriented of leading American spectator sports.[151]\nOverall, baseball has a large following in the United States; a 2006 poll found that nearly half of Americans are fans.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://news.gallup.com/poll/22240/nearly-half-americans-baseball-fans.aspx\", \"title\": \"Nearly Half of Americans are Baseball Fans\", \"last\": \"Jones\", \"first\": \"Jeffrey M.\", \"date\": \"April 4, 2006\", \"publisher\": \"Gallup\", \"accessdate\": \"May 31, 2018\"} In the late 1900s and early 2000s, baseball's position compared to football in the United States moved in contradictory directions.

regularly lead all programs in primetime in their markets during the summer.[161]\nIn Japan, where baseball is inarguably the leading spectator team sport, combined revenue for the twelve teams in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB), the body that oversees both the Central and Pacific Leagues, was estimated at $1\u00a0billion in 2007. Total NPB attendance for the year was approximately 20 million. While in the preceding two decades, MLB attendance grew by 50 percent and revenue nearly tripled, the comparable NPB figures were stagnant. There are concerns that MLB's growing interest in acquiring star Japanese players will hurt the game in their home country.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"April 11, 2007\", \"title\": \"Is the MLB Destroying Japan's National Pastime?\", \"url\": \"http://www.japantimes.co.jp/sports/2007/04/11/baseball/is-the-mlb-destroying-japans-national-pastime/\", \"work\": \"[[The Japan Times]]\", \"accessdate\": \"2009-02-08\", \"author\": \"Whiting, Robert\"} In Cuba, where baseball is by every reckoning the national sport,{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"2001\", \"title\": \"The Pride of Havana: A History of Cuban Baseball\", \"publisher\": \"[[Oxford University Press]]\", \"isbn\": \"978-0-19-514605-9\", \"oclc\": \"46601626\", \"last\": \"Gonz\\u00e1lez Echevarr\\u00eda\", \"first\": \"Roberto\"} the national team overshadows the city and provincial teams that play in the top-level domestic leagues.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"March 5, 2009\", \"title\": \"Cubans' Baseball Dreams Take Root on Rocky Fields\", \"url\": \"https://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/2009-03-05-3277668016_x.htm\", \"work\": \"USA Today\", \"agency\": \"Associated Press\", \"accessdate\": \"2009-04-28\", \"author\": \"Weissert, Will\"} Revenue figures are not released for the country's amateur system.

Dozens of English-language idioms have been derived from baseball; in particular, the game is the source of a number of widely used sexual euphemisms.[175] The first networked radio broadcasts in North America were of the 1922 World Series: famed sportswriter Grantland Rice announced play-by-play from New York City's Polo Grounds on WJZ\u2013Newark, New Jersey, which was connected by wire to WGY\u2013Schenectady, New York, and WBZ\u2013Springfield, Massachusetts.[176] The baseball cap has become a ubiquitous fashion item not only in the United States and Japan, but also in countries where the sport itself is not particularly popular, such as the United Kingdom.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.sfgate.com/opinion/openforum/article/Too-much-self-esteem-spoils-your-child-2552521.php\", \"title\": \"Too Much Self Esteem Spoils Your Child\", \"date\": \"July 6, 2007\", \"publisher\": \"New America Media\", \"accessdate\": \"2009-05-02\", \"author\": \"Lam, Andrew\"}\nBaseball has inspired many works of art and entertainment. One of the first major examples, Ernest Thayer's poem \"Casey at the Bat\", appeared in 1888. A wry description of the failure of a star player in what would now be called a \"clutch situation\", the poem became the source of vaudeville and other staged performances, audio recordings, film adaptations, and an opera, as well as a host of sequels and parodies in various media. There have been many baseball movies, including the Academy Award\u2013winning The Pride of the Yankees (1942) and the Oscar nominees The Natural (1984) and Field of Dreams (1989). The American Film Institute's selection of the ten best sports movies includes The Pride of the Yankees at number 3 and Bull Durham (1988) at number 5.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.afi.com/10top10/sports.html\", \"title\": \"AFI 10 Top 10\\u2014Top 10 Sports\", \"date\": \"June 17, 2008\", \"publisher\": \"[[American Film Institute]]\", \"accessdate\": \"2009-05-02\"} Baseball has provided thematic material for hits on both stage\u2014the Adler\u2013Ross musical Damn Yankees\u2014and record\u2014George J. Gaskin's \"Slide, Kelly, Slide\", Simon and Garfunkel's \"Mrs. Robinson\", and John Fogerty's \"Centerfield\".[179] The baseball-inspired comedic sketch \"Who's on First\", popularized by Abbott and Costello in 1938, quickly became famous. Six decades later, Time named it the best comedy routine of the 20th century.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"December 26, 1999\", \"title\": \"The Best of the Century\", \"url\": \"http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,36533,00.html\", \"urlstatus\": \"live\", \"work\": \"Time\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20090504145236/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C36533%2C00.html\", \"archivedate\": \"May 4, 2009\", \"accessdate\": \"2009-05-02\", \"df\": \"mdy-all\"}\nLiterary works connected to the game include the short fiction of Ring Lardner and novels such as Bernard Malamud's The Natural (the source for the movie), Robert Coover's The Universal Baseball Association, Inc., J. Henry Waugh, Prop., and W. P. Kinsella's Shoeless Joe (the source for Field of Dreams). Baseball's literary canon also includes the beat reportage of Damon Runyon; the columns of Grantland Rice, Red Smith, Dick Young, and Peter Gammons; and the essays of Roger Angell. Among the celebrated nonfiction books in the field are Lawrence S. Ritter's The Glory of Their Times, Roger Kahn's The Boys of Summer, and Michael Lewis's Moneyball. The 1970 publication of major league pitcher Jim Bouton's tell-all chronicle Ball Four is considered a turning point in the reporting of professional sports.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://static.espn.go.com/mlb/ballfour/neyer.html\", \"title\": \"'Ball Four' Changed Sports ''and'' Books\", \"authorlink\": \"Rob Neyer\", \"date\": \"June 15, 2000\", \"publisher\": \"ESPN.com\", \"accessdate\": \"2009-05-12\", \"author\": \"Neyer, Rob\"}\nBaseball has also inspired the creation of new cultural forms. Baseball cards were introduced in the late 19th century as trade cards. A typical example featured an image of a baseball player on one side and advertising for a business on the other. In the early 1900s they were produced widely as promotional items by tobacco and confectionery companies. The 1930s saw the popularization of the modern style of baseball card, with a player photograph accompanied on the rear by statistics and biographical data. Baseball cards\u2014many of which are now prized collectibles\u2014are the source of the much broader trading card industry, involving similar products for different sports and non-sports-related fields.[182]\nModern fantasy sports began in 1980 with the invention of Rotisserie League Baseball by New York writer Daniel Okrent and several friends. Participants in a Rotisserie league draft notional teams from the list of active MLB players and play out an entire imaginary season with game outcomes based on the players' latest real-world statistics. Rotisserie-style play quickly became a phenomenon. Now known more generically as fantasy baseball, it has inspired similar games based on an array of different sports.[183] The field boomed with increasing Internet access and new fantasy sports-related websites. By 2008, 29.9 million people in the United States and Canada were playing fantasy sports, spending $800\u00a0million on the hobby.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.prweb.com/releases/2008/07/prweb1084994.htm\", \"title\": \"Fantasy Sports Industry Grows to an $800 Million Industry with 29.9 Million Players\", \"date\": \"July 10, 2008\", \"accessdate\": \"2011-10-25\", \"work\": \"PRWeb\"} The burgeoning popularity of fantasy baseball is also credited with the increasing attention paid to sabermetrics\u2014first among fans, only later among baseball professionals.[185]\n\nExternal links\n\n",
