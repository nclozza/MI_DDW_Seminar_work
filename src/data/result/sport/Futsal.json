    "content": "Futsal\nFutsal (also known as f\u00fatsal or footsal) is a variant of association football played on a hard court, smaller than a football pitch, and mainly indoors. It has similarities to five-a-side football.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/27980859\", \"title\": \"World Cup 2014: Futsal \\u2013 the game behind Brazil's superstars\", \"date\": \"2 July 2014\", \"website\": \"[[BBC]] Sport\"}\nFutsal is played between two teams of five players each, one of whom is the goalkeeper. Unlimited substitutions are permitted. Unlike some other forms of indoor football, the game is played on a hard court surface delimited by lines; walls or boards are not used. Futsal is also played with a smaller, harder, low-bounce ball.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.cusa.ab.ca/league.php?scriptName=LEAGUEINFO&leagueID=1000&leagueInfoID=6273\", \"title\": \"Comparison between FUTSAL and SOCCER\", \"accessdate\": \"2007-03-02\", \"archiveurl \": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20070929015543/http://www.cusa.ab.ca/league.php?scriptName=LEAGUEINFO&leagueID=1000&leagueInfoID=6273\"} The surface, ball and rules together favour ball control and passing in small spaces.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.2cfutsal.com/new-to-futsal\", \"title\": \"New to Futsal\", \"website\": \"2C Futsal\", \"language\": \"en-us\"} The game's \"emphasis is on improvisation, creativity and technique\".{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"title\": \"How will English football develop?\", \"url\": \"http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/skills/7143587.stm\", \"work\": \"BBC News\", \"accessdate\": \"2007-12-18\"}\n\nNaming\nFutsal comes from Spanish f\u00fatbol sala or f\u00fatbol de sal\u00f3n and from Portuguese futebol de sal\u00e3o. The term is commonly translated as \"indoor football\", but a more literal translation is \"hall/lounge football\". During the sport's second world championships held in Madrid in 1985, the Spanish name f\u00fatbol sala was used. Since then, all other names have been officially and internationally changed to futsal. The naming was due to a dispute between FIFUSA (the predecessor to the AMF) and FIFA over the name of f\u00fatbol, FIFUSA has registered the word fut-sal in 1985 (Madrid, Spain). Since then FIFA has also started using the term futsal. The name has been translated into Italian as calcio a 5 (literally 5-a-side football) or football sala and French as football de salle.\n\nOrigins\n\"Futsal\" started in 1930 when Juan Carlos Ceriani\u00a0[fr], a teacher in Montevideo, Uruguay, created a version of indoor football for recreation in YMCAs.[citation needed] This new sport was originally developed for playing on basketball courts,{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.futsal.com/index.php/history-of-futsal-\", \"title\": \"History of Futsal\", \"last\": \"Administrator\"} and a rule book was published in September 1933.[citation needed] Football was already highly popular in the country and after Uruguay won the 1930 World Cup and gold medals in the 1924 and 1928 Summer Olympics, it attracted even more practitioners. Ceriani's goal was to create a team game that could be played indoor or outdoor but that was similar to football.\nCeriani, writing the rule book, took as examples the principles of football (the possibility to touch the ball with every part of the body except for the hands), and he took rules from other sports too: from basketball the number of team players (five) and the game duration (40 actual minutes); from water polo the rules about the goalkeeper; from team handball for the field and goal sizes.\nThe YMCA spread the game immediately throughout South America. It was easily played by everyone, everywhere, and in any weather condition, without any difficulty, helping players to stay in shape all year round. These reasons convinced Jo\u00e3o Lotufo, a Brazilian, to bring this game to his country and adapt it to the needs of physical education.[citation needed]\nInitially, the rules were not uniform. In 1956, the rules were modified by Habib Maphuz and Luiz Gonzaga de Oliveira Fernandes within the YMCA of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil to allow seniors to compete.[citation needed] Luiz de Oliveira wrote the Book of Rules of Fuitsal in 1956, then adopted also at the international level.\nIn 1965, the Confederaci\u00f3n Sudamericana de F\u00fatbol de Sal\u00f3n\u00a0[pt] (South American Futsal Confederation) was formed, consisting of Uruguay, Paraguay, Peru, Argentina and Brazil.\nShortly after, a unique tournament was organized. It attracted some interest in South American media, which regularly began to follow futsal. In particular, it was the journalist Jos\u00e9 Ant\u00f4nio Ingl\u00eaz who passionately contributed to the rapid spread of the game, as well as being credited as the man who coined the name \u201cfutsal\u201d to define the sport.\n\nFrom FIFUSA to AMF\nThe sport began to spread across South America, and its popularity ensured the formation of a governing body in S\u00e3o Paulo in 1971, under the name of Federaci\u00f3n Internacional de F\u00fatbol de Sal\u00f3n (FIFUSA). FIFUSA initially comprised Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay, Peru, Portugal, and Uruguay, along with the World Championships. The new institution counted 32 participating countries and its first President was Jo\u00e3o Havelange joined by the secretary Luiz Gonzaga de Oliveira. In 1975, the Federation's chief passed to FIFA, and in 1980, Janu\u00e1rio D'Alessio Neto was elected to work to make this sport recognized worldwide by supranational bodies.\nThe first FIFUSA World Championships were held in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, in 1982 with the hosting Brazilian team crowned champions against Paraguay in front of an audience of 12,000 people, with Uruguay placing third. The Federation then began to work to bring the big event to Europe. In 1985, the second futsal World Cup was organized in Madrid, Spain, where the Brazilian team won again. The event was a success, with a considerable media interest and a huge response from the audience, thanks to the Spanish TV station that filmed the event.\nIn 1985, Joseph Blatter, at that time secretary of football's governing body, FIFA, thought it was the right time to enlarge its influence and therefore also deal with indoor football. Knowing that the Federation President Jo\u00e3o Havelange was the head of FIFUSA from 1971 to 1974, the Swiss decided to summon in Brazil the world governing body of futsal: surprisingly, the Congress voted against the unification. Due to a dispute between FIFA and FIFUSA over the name of f\u00fatbol, FIFUSA has registered the word fut-sal in 1985 (Madrid, Spain).\nFIFA wanted to promote and spread its own version of indoor football, different from the original one played in the South American countries, but they could not manage to come to an agreement with FIFUSA in the Rio de Janeiro Congress in 1989.\nOn 2 May 1990, the Brazilian federation finally broke away from FIFUSA, and on 25 September, an event in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia contributed to the founding of the Confederaci\u00f3n Panamericana de Futbol de Salon (PANAFUTSAL) together with Paraguay, Colombia, Mexico, Uruguay, Argentina, Venezuela, Costa Rica, Puerto Rico, Bolivia, Ecuador, the Netherlands Antilles, Aruba, and Canada.\nThe conference held in Guatemala in 2000 between members of PANAFUTSAL and FIFA focused on the resolution of the dispute between the two institutions and on the achievement of futsal in the pure version that excited many in South America. The signing of the Protocol, however, was not followed by concrete actions. FIFA kept on promoting its version of futsal. So the PANAFUTSAL decided to create a new worldwide body for the preservation of futsal. In December 2002, the Asociaci\u00f3n Mundial de Futsal (AMF) was founded. It is currently composed of 40 national federations and three continental bodies, one of which was FIFS.\nIn 2002, members of PANAFUTSAL formed AMF, an international futsal governing body independent of FIFA, in reaction to the alleged stagnancy of futsal under FIFUSA.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.futsalonline.com/laws.html\", \"title\": \"AMF Sets Up Committee to Study Laws of the Game\", \"publisher\": \"Futsal Online\"} Both FIFA and AMF continue to administer the game.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.futsalplanet.com/news/news-01.asp?id=1041\", \"title\": \"Futsal Planet News \\u2013 World Futsal Association is formed\", \"publisher\": \"Futsal Planet\", \"accessdate\": \"2008-01-31\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20110429091656/http://www.futsalplanet.com/news/news-01.asp?id=1041\", \"archivedate\": \"2011-04-29\"}\n\nGoverning bodies\nThe two most important governing bodies of futsal are the Asociaci\u00f3n Mundial de F\u00fatsal (AMF) and F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA). AMF is the successor organization to the original governing body. FIFA later took an interest in futsal. However, talks between FIFA and AMF to reconcile governance were not successful. FIFA organizes its own separate competitions.\nThe International Futsal Alliance (IFA) is a partnership of countries formed to offer high quality futsal tournaments throughout the world. It sees itself as ancillary rather than competing with FIFA. Its membership spans countries from North and South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Oceania. Several tournaments have been organized under the auspices of IFA, including a world cup for men held in 2019 and one for women held in 2017.[8]\nConfederaci\u00f3n Panamericana de Futsal\u00a0[pt] (CPFS/PANAFUTSAL)\n\nRules\nThere are currently two governing bodies: Asociaci\u00f3n Mundial de F\u00fatsal (AMF) and F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA). AMF and FIFA are responsible for maintaining and regulating the official rules of their respective versions of futsal.\nFIFA publishes its futsal rules as the 'Laws of the Game', in which each of the 17 'laws' is a thematically related collection of individual regulations. The laws define all aspects of the game, including what may be changed to suit local competitions and leagues.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/footballdevelopment/technicalsupport/futsal/lawsofthegame.html\", \"title\": \"Futsal Laws of the game\", \"publisher\": \"FIFA\"}\nMany of the laws are similar or identical to those found in association football, or reference association football in their absence (such as a section noting that there is no offside infraction in futsal.)\n\nPlayers, equipment and officials\nThere are five players on the field on each team, one of whom is the goalkeeper. The maximum number of substitutes allowed is nine (FIFA change 2012), with unlimited substitutions during the match. Substitutes can come on even when the ball is in play but the player coming off must leave the field before the substitute can enter the playing field.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/futsal/en/law3_en.htm\", \"title\": \"Futsal Laws of the game (Law 3)\", \"publisher\": \"FIFA\", \"accessdate\": \"2008-01-23\", \"archiveurl \": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20080109072757/http://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/futsal/en/law3_en.htm\"} If a team has or is reduced to fewer than three players remaining, the match is abandoned and counted as a loss for the team with the lack of players.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/futsal/en/law3.1_en.htm\", \"title\": \"Futsal Laws of the game (Law 3)\", \"publisher\": \"FIFA\", \"accessdate\": \"2008-01-23\", \"archiveurl \": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20080114073822/http://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/futsal/en/law3.1_en.htm\"}\nThe kit is made up of a jersey or shirt with sleeves, shorts, socks, shinguards made out of metal, plastic or foam, and shoes with rubber soles. The goalkeeper is allowed to wear long trousers and a different coloured kit to distinguish themself from the other players on the team and the referee. The goalkeeper is also allowed to wear elbow pads because the surface is about as hard as a tennis court or basketball court.

Also punishable with a red card is denying an opponent moving towards the player's goal a goalscoring opportunity by committing an offence punishable by a free kick or a penalty kick and using offensive, insulting or abusive language or gestures.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/futsal/en/law12b_en.htm\", \"title\": \"Futsal Laws of the game (Law 12)\", \"publisher\": \"FIFA\", \"accessdate\": \"2008-01-26\", \"archiveurl \": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20071112172442/http://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/futsal/en/law12b_en.htm\"} A player who has been sent off must leave the vicinity of the field.\nA substitute player is permitted to come on two minutes after a teammate has been sent off, unless a goal is scored before the end of the two minutes. If a team with more players scores against a team with fewer players, another player can be added to the team with an inferior number of players. If the teams are equal when the goal is scored or if the team with fewer players scores, both teams remain with the same number of players.\n\nMen's ranking\nThere is currently no official futsal ranking.\nAs of 2\u00a0December\u00a02019[update], the top 25 teams according to one Elo-based ranking system are:{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.futsalworldranking.be/rank.htm\", \"title\": \"Futsal World Ranking\", \"publisher\": \"Futsalworldranking.be\"}\nThere is another elo-based ranking system at The Roon Ba website.[31]\n Calculate Function \nwhere:\n\nWomen's ranking\nAs of 11 March 2020, according to a ranking based partly on the ELO system, the top 10 teams are:[32]\n\nWorld University Futsal Championship\nMen's\nWomen's\n^n/a  A round-robin tournament determined the final standings.\n\nChina International Futsal Tournament\nCFA Futsal International Tournaments - Changshu Story\n^n/a  A round-robin tournament determined the final standings.\nHangzhou International Futsal Tournament Story\n^n/a  A round-robin tournament determined the final standings.\n\nTiger's Cup/World 5's Futsal\n^n/a  A round-robin tournament determined the final standings.\n\nExternal links\n\n",
