    "content": "Parkour\n\nParkour (French:\u00a0[pa\u0281ku\u0281]) is a training discipline using movement that developed from military obstacle course training. Practitioners, called tracers or traceurs, aim to get from one point to another in a complex environment, without assistive equipment and in the fastest and most efficient way possible. Parkour includes running, climbing, swinging, vaulting, jumping, plyometrics, rolling, quadrupedal movement (crawling) and other movements as deemed most suitable for the situation (not to be confused with freerunning).{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.flowjournal.org/2010/05/from-%E2%80%9Cplay-to-display%E2%80%9D-parkour-as-media-mimetics-or-nature-reclamation-matthew-ferrari-university-of-massachusetts-amherst/\", \"title\": \"From 'Play to Display': Parkour as Media-Mimetics or Nature Reclamation?\", \"last\": \"Ferrari\", \"first\": \"Matthew\", \"date\": \"7 May 2010\", \"urlstatus\": \"live\", \"work\": \"FlowTV, vol 11, lokaliseret den 01-04-2011 p\\u00e5\"}{\"citetype\": \"journal\", \"year\": \"2011\", \"title\": \"Parkour and the Built Environment: Spatial Practices and the Plasticity of School Buildings\", \"url\": \"http://journal.jctonline.org/index.php/jct/article/view/126\", \"journal\": \"Journal of Curriculum Theorizing\", \"volume\": \"27\", \"issue\": \"3\", \"page\": \"209\", \"last\": \"De Feitas\", \"first\": \"Elizabeth\"} Parkour's development from military training gives it some aspects of a non-combative martial art.\nParkour is an activity that can be practiced alone or with others and is usually carried out in urban spaces, though it can be done anywhere.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"last1\": \"Rawlinson\", \"first1\": \"Christopher\", \"last2\": \"Guaralda\", \"first2\": \"Mirko\", \"date\": \"11 September 2012\", \"title\": \"In Out of Control: 8th International Conference on Design and Emotion\", \"url\": \"http://eprints.qut.edu.au/51313/\", \"location\": \"Central Saint Martins College of Arts and Design, London\", \"accessdate\": \"16 March 2013\", \"contribution\": \"Chaos and creativity of play: designing emotional engagement in public spaces\"}{\"citetype\": \"journal\", \"doi \": \"10.1007/s00146-010-0294-2\", \"title \": \"Nice-looking obstacles: Parkour as urban practice of deterritorialization\", \"journal \": \"AI & Society\", \"volume \": \"26\", \"issue \": \"2\", \"pages \": \"143\\u2013152\", \"year \": \"2010\", \"last1 \": \"Brunner\", \"first1 \": \"C.\", \"url \": \"http://doc.rero.ch/record/312807/files/146_2010_Article_294.pdf\"} Parkour involves seeing one's environment in a new way, and imagining the potential for navigating it by movement around, across, through, over and under its features.[8][9]\nParkour as a type of movement was established by the French David Belle in 1988{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://parkourgenerations.com/parkour-history/\", \"title\": \"Parkour History\", \"date\": \"22 August 2014\", \"publisher\": \"Parkour Generations\", \"accessdate\": \"2 December 2015\"}{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYwQLvIkQ88\", \"title\": \"Interview with David Belle\", \"accessdate\": \"2 December 2015\"}, however the practice of similar movements in various communities around the world leads to discuss the relevance of such an attribution {\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"2011\", \"title\": \"Cin\\u00e9 Parkour\", \"isbn\": \"978-0-9569717-1-5\", \"ref\": \"Angel\", \"last\": \"Angel\", \"first\": \"Julie\"}.

Kound\u00e9 suggested he change the \"c\" of \"parcours\" to a \"k\" because it was stronger and more dynamic, and to remove the silent \"s\" for the same reason, forming \"parkour\".[19]\nA practitioner of parkour is called a traceur, with the feminine form being traceuse.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.flowjournal.org/2010/05/from-%E2%80%9Cplay-to-display%E2%80%9D-parkour-as-media-mimetics-or-nature-reclamation-matthew-ferrari-university-of-massachusetts-amherst/\", \"title\": \"From 'Play to Display': Parkour as Media-Mimetics or Nature Reclamation?\", \"last\": \"Ferrari\", \"first\": \"Matthew\", \"date\": \"7 May 2010\", \"urlstatus\": \"live\", \"work\": \"FlowTV, vol 11, lokaliseret den 01-04-2011 p\\u00e5\"} They are nouns derived from the French verb tracer, which normally means \"to trace\", as in \"tracing a path\", in reference to drawing.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.cnrtl.fr/lexicographie/tracer?\", \"title\": \"Portail lexical&nbsp;\\u2014 D\\u00e9finition de tracer\", \"language\": \"French\", \"accessdate\": \"28 August 2007\"} The verb tracer used familiarly means: \"to hurry up\".[21] The term traceur was originally the name of a parkour group headed by David Belle which included S\u00e9bastien Foucan and St\u00e9phane Vigroux.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_d1AxUPPcF8\", \"title\": \"An Interview With Stephane Vigroux\", \"date\": \"27 January 2009\", \"publisher\": \"YouTube\", \"accessdate\": \"22 May 2014\"}\nA jam refers to a meeting of traceurs, involving training lasting anywhere from hours to several days, often with people from different cities. The first parkour jam was organised in July 2002 by Romain Drouet, with a dozen people including S\u00e9bastien Foucan and St\u00e9phane Vigroux.\n\nGeorges H\u00e9bert\nIn Western Europe, a forerunner of parkour was developed by French naval officer Georges H\u00e9bert, who before World War I promoted athletic skill based on the models of indigenous tribes he had met in Africa.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.urbanfreeflow.com/articles/methode_naturelle.htm\", \"title\": \"Georges Hebert and the Natural Method of Physical Culture\", \"accessdate\": \"2 July 2013\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20050323090031/http://www.urbanfreeflow.com/articles/methode_naturelle.htm\", \"archivedate\": \"23 March 2005\", \"author\": \"Artful Dodger\"} He noted, \"their bodies were splendid, flexible, nimble, skillful, enduring, and resistant but yet they had no other tutor in gymnastics but their lives in nature.\"{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.urbanfreeflow.com/articles/methode_naturelle.htm\", \"title\": \"Georges Hebert and the Natural Method of Physical Culture\", \"accessdate\": \"2 July 2013\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20050323090031/http://www.urbanfreeflow.com/articles/methode_naturelle.htm\", \"archivedate\": \"23 March 2005\", \"author\": \"Artful Dodger\"} His rescue efforts during the 1902 eruption of Mount Pel\u00e9e on Saint-Pierre, Martinique, reinforced his belief that athletic skill must be combined with courage and altruism.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.urbanfreeflow.com/articles/methode_naturelle.htm\", \"title\": \"Georges Hebert and the Natural Method of Physical Culture\", \"accessdate\": \"2 July 2013\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20050323090031/http://www.urbanfreeflow.com/articles/methode_naturelle.htm\", \"archivedate\": \"23 March 2005\", \"author\": \"Artful Dodger\"} H\u00e9bert became a physical education tutor at the college of Reims in France. H\u00e9bert set up a \"m\u00e9thode naturelle\" (natural method) session consisting of ten fundamental groups: walking, running, jumping, quadrupedal movement, climbing, balancing, throwing, lifting, self-defence and swimming. These were intended to develop \"the three main forces\": energetic (willpower, courage, coolness, and firmness), moral (benevolence, assistance, honour, and honesty) and physical (muscles and breath).{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://perso.orange.fr/le.parkour/france/medias/page3.html\", \"title\": \"Georges H\\u00e9bert&nbsp;\\u2014 la methode naturalle\", \"publisher\": \"INSEP&nbsp;\\u2014 Mus\\u00e9e de la Marine\", \"language\": \"French\", \"format\": \"JPG\", \"accessdate\": \"22 September 2007\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20060718150740/http://perso.orange.fr/le.parkour/france/medias/page3.html\", \"archivedate\": \"18 July 2006\"} During World War I and World War II, teaching continued to expand, becoming the standard system of French military education and training.

During the First Indochina War, his father died and he was separated from his mother, after which he was sent to a military orphanage in Da Lat at the age of 7. He took it upon himself to train harder and longer than everyone else in order never to be a victim. At night, when everyone else was asleep, he would be outside running or climbing trees. He would use the military obstacle courses in secret, and also created courses of his own that tested his endurance, strength, and flexibility. Doing this enabled him not only to survive the hardships he experienced during his childhood, but also eventually to thrive. After the Battle of Dien Bien Phu in 1954, he returned to France and remained in military education until the age of 19, when he joined the Paris Fire Brigade, a French Army unit.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"2011\", \"title\": \"Cin\\u00e9 Parkour\", \"isbn\": \"978-0-9569717-1-5\", \"ref\": \"Angel\", \"last\": \"Angel\", \"first\": \"Julie\"}[26]{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://parkour.net/modules/articles/item.php?itemid=3\", \"title\": \"Raymond Belle's biography\", \"date\": \"17 February 2006\", \"publisher\": \"Parkour.NET\", \"accessdate\": \"29 November 2007\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20060217200929/http://parkour.net/modules/articles/item.php?itemid=3\", \"archivedate\": \"17 February 2006\", \"work\": \"Original French biography sourced from 'Allo Dix-Huit', the magazine of the Parisian pompiers.\"}\nRaymond's son, David Belle, was born in 1973. He experimented with gymnastics and athletics but became increasingly disaffected with both school and the sports clubs. As he got older, he claims to have to read (as-yet-unconfirmed) newspaper clippings that told of his father's exploits and was increasingly curious about what had enabled his father to accomplish these feats. Through conversations with his father, he realised that what he really wanted was a means to develop skills that would be useful to him in life, rather than just training to kick a ball or perform moves in a padded, indoor environment.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"2011\", \"title\": \"Cin\\u00e9 Parkour\", \"isbn\": \"978-0-9569717-1-5\", \"ref\": \"Angel\", \"last\": \"Angel\", \"first\": \"Julie\"}[18]\nThrough   conversations with his father, David learned about this way of training that his father called \"parcours\". He heard his father talk of the many repetitions he had done in order to find the best way of doing things. He learned  that for his father, training was not a game but something vital which enabled him to survive and to protect the people he cared about. David realised that this was what he had been searching for, and so he began training in the same way. After a time, he found it far more important to him than schooling and he gave up his other commitments to focus all his time on his training.[18]\n\nYamakasi\nDavid initially trained on his own, and after moving to Lisses, found other young men (including his cousins) who had similar desires, and they began to train together.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://davidbelle.com/biography-eng/\", \"title\": \"Actor David Belle Biography\", \"publisher\": \"David Belle\", \"accessdate\": \"22 May 2014\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20141020053729/http://davidbelle.com/biography-eng/\", \"archivedate\": \"20 October 2014\"} The group eventually included David Belle, S\u00e9bastien Foucan, Ch\u00e2u Belle Dinh, Williams Belle, Yann Hnautra, Laurent Piemontesi, Guylain N'Guba Boyeke, Malik Diouf, and Charles Perri\u00e8re.\n\nDiscipline\nThe group put themselves through challenges that forced them to find the physical and mental strength to succeed. Examples included training without food or water, or sleeping on the floor without a blanket, to learn to endure the cold.[28] For example, no one in the group was permitted to be late for training, as it would hold back the whole group. If any member completed a challenge, everyone else had to do the same thing.[29] During their training no one was allowed to complain or be negative. Few excuses were allowed. For instance, if someone claimed that his shoes were too worn out in order to make a jump, he had to do it anyway, even if it meant doing the jump barefoot.[30] At the same time, everyone was required to have knowledge of their own limits.[31]\nRespecting one's health and physical well-being was one of the foundations of the group. If any member hurt himself during or after the execution of a movement, the movement was deemed a failure. A movement executed only once was not considered an achievement; only with repetition was the challenge complete. Every movement had to be repeated at least ten times in a row without the traceur having to push his limits or sustaining any injury. If any mistake was made by any traceur in the group everyone had to start all over again.[29]\nHumility was an important principle.[31] No traceur was allowed to feel superior over someone else, for example by executing a movement only to show off in front of someone who could not perform the movement. If any traceur in the group claimed that he had completed a difficult and dangerous challenge that should not be attempted unaided, he had to prove his claims by doing the challenge again. Anyone who lied violated the principle of humility.[29]\nTo join the group, new members had to be recommended by an existing member and then pass tests to evaluate their motivation for joining.[30] Despite the huge emphasis on the collective, each traceur had to progress and develop independently \u2014 \"to create the means to be yourself\"[32] \u2014 and there was a complete trust within the group.[31] Every traceur was to encourage the others and show confidence through their behaviour.[33] If a member violated the principles, the group could meet without the offending person to discuss various punishments. Anyone deemed unsuitable could be temporarily or even permanently banned from the group in order to uphold its disciplines and values.[34]\nThe group also drew influence from Asian cultures, notably the acrobatic antics of Jackie Chan in his Hong Kong action films,{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"last1\": \"Stratford\", \"first1\": \"Elaine\", \"date\": \"2014\", \"title\": \"Geographies, Mobilities, and Rhythms over the Life-Course: Adventures in the Interval\", \"url\": \"https://books.google.com/books?id=d4yLBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA79\", \"publisher\": \"[[Routledge]]\", \"page\": \"79\", \"isbn\": \"9781135117429\"}{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"last1\": \"Hunt\", \"first1\": \"Leon\", \"last2\": \"Wing-Fai\", \"first2\": \"Leung\", \"date\": \"2010\", \"title\": \"East Asian Cinemas: Exploring Transnational Connections on Film\", \"url\": \"https://books.google.com/books?id=pzgBAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA229\", \"publisher\": \"[[I.B.

S\u00e9bastien Foucan also invented a name for what they were doing: \"l'art du d\u00e9placement\" (French for \"the art of movement\").[38] The firefighter performance caused both positive and negative attention. Some members of the group were concerned how the public would view their discipline since the performance did not demonstrate all aspects of it, such as their hard training and their values and ethics. Jean-Fran\u00e7ois also sent pictures and video of the group to a French TV programme, and the popularity of parkour began to increase. A series of television programmes in various countries subsequently featured video footage of the group, and they began to get more requests for performances. During this time, conflicting interests arose within the group. S\u00e9bastien Foucan wanted to teach more rather than to train more, and David Belle had the ambition to become an actor. David and S\u00e9bastien chose to leave the group, and used the name \"parkour\" to describe their activity (see \u00a7 Etymology above). The seven remaining Yamakasi members continued to use the term l'art du d\u00e9placement{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"2011\", \"title\": \"Cin\\u00e9 Parkour\", \"isbn\": \"978-0-9569717-1-5\", \"ref\": \"Angel\", \"last\": \"Angel\", \"first\": \"Julie\"}[39] (see \u00a7 Derivative terminologies and disciplines below).\n\nOrganizations\nNational parkour organizations include the World Freerunning and Parkour Federation, established in 2007, who have worked with MTV to produce Parkour related shows.[40]\nInternational Gymnastics Federation (FIG) added parkour as one of their disciplines in 2017, receiving lots of opposition.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.accessparkour.com/fig-gate-the-story-so-far/\", \"title\": \"Fig-Gate: The Great Parkour Scandal\", \"date\": \"11 May 2017\", \"publisher\": \"accessparkour.com\"}{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1051013/denmark-add-voice-to-opposition-of-figs-move-into-parkour\", \"title\": \"Denmark add voice to opposition of FIG's move into parkour\", \"date\": \"1 June 2017\", \"publisher\": \"insidethegames.biz\"}{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1053647/parkour-earth-officially-becomes-sports-international-federation-as-fig-row-continues\", \"title\": \"Parkour Earth officially launches as FIG row continues\", \"date\": \"4 August 2017\", \"publisher\": \"insidethegames.biz\"} Programme includes Speed-Run (Sprint) and Freestyle.

What I'm interested in is what the guy's got in his head, if he has self-confidence, if he masters the technique, if he has understood the principles of parkour. I just can't deal with guys who do Parkour because they saw videos on the Internet and thought it was kinda cool and want to do even better.\"[58] Further, he states the importance of traceurs being aware of their abilities and limitations, and developing in their own way. \"When a young person asks me: 'Can you show me how to do this?' I simply answer: \"No, I am going to show you how I do it. Then, you'll have to learn with your own technique, your own way of moving, your style, your abilities and your limitations. You are going to learn to be yourself, not someone else.\"[59]\nThe philosophy of parkour has been compared to that of martial arts.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.worldwidejam.tv/db.bl.jam.parkour.html\", \"title\": \"Bruce Lee and the Philosophy of Parkour\", \"last\": \"Green\", \"first\": \"Rob\", \"publisher\": \"WorldWideJam.tv\", \"accessdate\": \"1 February 2011\"} In an interview with The New Yorker, David Belle acknowledges the influence: \"There's a quote by Bruce Lee that's my motto: 'There are no limits.

It's really cool!' But if tomorrow I made you do real training, you would end up crying. That's what you need to know: you are going to cry, you are going to bleed and you are going to sweat like never before.\"[61] In his book, Belle also quotes his father Raymond: \"If two roads open up before you, always take the most difficult one. Because you know you can travel the easy one.\"[62]\nBelle is an influential proponent of discipline and control in parkour, saying, \"Precision is all about being measured,\" and going on to describe parkour as an art that requires huge amounts of repetition and practice to master.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUeHrPazTtY\", \"title\": \"David Belle \\u2013 Parkour\", \"date\": \"16 July 2011\", \"publisher\": \"YouTube\", \"accessdate\": \"22 May 2014\"} \"With parkour, I often say, 'Once is never'. In other words, someone can manage a jump one time but it does not mean anything. It can be luck or chance. When you make a jump, you have to do it at least three times to be sure you can actually do it. It's an unavoidable rule. Do it the hard way and stop lying to yourself. When you come for training, you have to train. Even if it means doing the same jump fifty or a hundred times.\"[59] To its founder, parkour is a method of self-refinement, used for learning to control and focus oneself.\n\nMovement\nWhile there is no official list of \"moves\" in parkour, the style in which practitioners move often sets them apart from others,{\"citetype\": \"journal\", \"year\": \"2011\", \"title\": \"Parkour and the Built Environment: Spatial Practices and the Plasticity of School Buildings\", \"url\": \"http://journal.jctonline.org/index.php/jct/article/view/126\", \"journal\": \"Journal of Curriculum Theorizing\", \"volume\": \"27\", \"issue\": \"3\", \"page\": \"209\", \"last\": \"De Feitas\", \"first\": \"Elizabeth\"} and there are a number of movements considered fundamental.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://parkourgenerations.com/parkour-history/\", \"title\": \"Parkour History\", \"date\": \"22 August 2014\", \"publisher\": \"Parkour Generations\", \"accessdate\": \"2 December 2015\"} Some examples of common movements are:[64]{\"citetype\": \"journal\", \"doi \": \"10.1016/j.injury.2006.04.119\", \"pmid \": \"16806217\", \"title \": \"Paediatric fractures sustained in Parkour (free running)\", \"journal \": \"Injury\", \"volume \": \"37\", \"issue \": \"8\", \"pages \": \"795\\u2013797\", \"year \": \"2006\", \"last1 \": \"McLean\", \"first1 \": \"C.

In the documentary, the term \"freerunning\" was used as an attempt to translate \"parkour\", in order to make it more appealing to the English-speaking audience.[128] Foucan decided to keep using the term \"freerunning\" to describe his discipline, to distinguish it from David Belle's methods.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"2008\", \"title\": \"Free Running\", \"pages\": \"8\\u20139\", \"isbn\": \"978-1-56975-652-2\", \"last\": \"Foucan\", \"first\": \"S\\u00e9bastien\", \"authorlink\": \"S\\u00e9bastien Foucan\"}[130]\nThe remaining seven Yamakasi members continued to use the term \"l'art du d\u00e9placement\", also not wanting to associate it too closely with parkour. Similar to S\u00e9bastien's freerunning, l'art du d\u00e9placement was less about the hard discipline from the original Yamakasi group, more a participatory approach focused on making the teaching more accessible. David Belle kept the term \"parkour\", saying the group contributed to the development of it, but that his father was the source of his motivation, who had verbally communicated this method only to him.[130]\nBoth parkour and freerunning encompass the ideas of overcoming obstacles and self-expression; in freerunning, the greater emphasis is on self-expression.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"2008\", \"title\": \"Free Running\", \"pages\": \"8\\u20139\", \"isbn\": \"978-1-56975-652-2\", \"last\": \"Foucan\", \"first\": \"S\\u00e9bastien\", \"authorlink\": \"S\\u00e9bastien Foucan\"} Although the differences between the disciplines are often hard to discern, practitioners tend to aspire to parkour and describe themselves as traceurs rather than as freerunners.{\"citetype\": \"journal\", \"doi \": \"10.1111/j.1540-6040.2012.01406.x\", \"title \": \"Parkour, the Affective Appropriation of Urban Space, and the Real/Virtual Dialectic\", \"journal \": \"City & Community\", \"volume \": \"11\", \"issue \": \"3\", \"pages \": \"229\\u2013253\", \"year \": \"2012\", \"last1 \": \"Kidder\", \"first1 \": \"J.
