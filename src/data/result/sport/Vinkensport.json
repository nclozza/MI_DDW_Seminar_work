    "content": "Vinkensport\n\nVinkensport (Dutch for \"finch sport\") is a competitive animal sport in which male common chaffinches are made to compete for the highest number of bird calls in an hour. Also called vinkenzetting (\"finch sitting\"), it is primarily active in the Dutch-speaking region of Flanders in Belgium.\nVinkensport traces its origins to competitions held by Flemish merchants in 1596, and is considered part of traditional Flemish culture. As of 2007, it was estimated that there are over 13,000 enthusiasts, called vinkeniers (\"finchers\"), breeding 10,000 birds every year. Animal rights activists oppose the sport.\n\nDescription\nIn a contest, a row of small cages, each housing a single male finch, is lined up approximately six feet apart along a street. The proximity of the cages increases the number of calls, as the birds sing for mates and to establish territory.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"May 21, 2007\", \"title\": \"One-Ounce Belgian Idols Vie for Most Tweets per Hour\", \"work\": \"[[The New York Times]]\", \"publisher\": \"The New York Times Company\", \"accessdate\": \"2007-05-23\", \"first\": \"Bilefsky\", \"last\": \"Dan\"} A timekeeper begins and ends the contest with a red flag. Every time a bird sings a correct terminating flourish to their call\u2014most often transcribed as susk-e-wiet\u2014a tally mark in chalk is made on a long wooden stick. The bird singing its song the most times during one hour wins the contest. Champion finches regularly sing hundreds of calls in contests.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"May 21, 2007\", \"title\": \"One-Ounce Belgian Idols Vie for Most Tweets per Hour\", \"work\": \"[[The New York Times]]\", \"publisher\": \"The New York Times Company\", \"accessdate\": \"2007-05-23\", \"first\": \"Bilefsky\", \"last\": \"Dan\"}\n\nHistory and practices\nThe earliest known records of vinkeniers are from 1596 (with some sources advocating a slightly earlier 1593 origin) with Flemish merchants competing.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"May 21, 2007\", \"title\": \"One-Ounce Belgian Idols Vie for Most Tweets per Hour\", \"work\": \"[[The New York Times]]\", \"publisher\": \"The New York Times Company\", \"accessdate\": \"2007-05-23\", \"first\": \"Bilefsky\", \"last\": \"Dan\"} By the late nineteenth century, vinkenzetting's popularity had diminished significantly, but it saw a resurgence after the First World War. As of 2007, it was estimated that there are over 13,000 vinkeniers breeding 10,000 birds every year. However, the popularity of this folk sport is waning in the 21st century.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"May 21, 2007\", \"title\": \"One-Ounce Belgian Idols Vie for Most Tweets per Hour\", \"work\": \"[[The New York Times]]\", \"publisher\": \"The New York Times Company\", \"accessdate\": \"2007-05-23\", \"first\": \"Bilefsky\", \"last\": \"Dan\"} There is also a museum of the sport (Nationaal Volkssportmuseum Vinkensport) in the village of Hulste in the Harelbeke municipality of Belgium.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"1999\", \"title\": \"Weird Europe: A Guide to Bizarre, Macabre, and Just Plain Weird Sights\", \"publisher\": \"Macmillan\", \"isbn\": \"978-0-312-19873-2\", \"author\": \"Lawson, Kristan\"}\nVinkeniers use a variety of methods to increase the number of calls in their birds. Techniques to develop singing aptitude include selective breeding programs, high-protein diets, and stimulating them with music and recordings of bird song. As wild finches generally begin singing during the spring mating season, keepers may also use artificial lights placed in aviaries to encourage increased song.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"May 21, 2007\", \"title\": \"One-Ounce Belgian Idols Vie for Most Tweets per Hour\", \"work\": \"[[The New York Times]]\", \"publisher\": \"The New York Times Company\", \"accessdate\": \"2007-05-23\", \"first\": \"Bilefsky\", \"last\": \"Dan\"}\nSome vinkeniers claim that finches from the different regions of Belgium sing in different dialects; with birds from the Dutch-speaking Flanders singing \"in Dutch\" and those from the French-speaking Wallonia singing undesirably \"in French\".{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"May 21, 2007\", \"title\": \"One-Ounce Belgian Idols Vie for Most Tweets per Hour\", \"work\": \"[[The New York Times]]\", \"publisher\": \"The New York Times Company\", \"accessdate\": \"2007-05-23\", \"first\": \"Bilefsky\", \"last\": \"Dan\"} The use of \"Dutch\" and \"Walloon\" to describe these two supposed types of finches has been suggested to refer to a simple difference in calling not literally linked to either the Flemish or Walloon communities of Belgium, and some linguists even suggest that \"Walloon\" simply means \"foreign\".{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"title\": \"Dialect variation in the terminal flourishes of Flemish chaffinches\", \"last\": \"Liberman\", \"first\": \"Mark\", \"accessdate\": \"2007-05-29\", \"work\": \"Language Log\"} While minute regional differences (a.k.a. dialects) in song have been observed in the chaffinch (also within Belgium), the differences have only been reliably distinguishable by the use of sonograms.[4]{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/wildfacts/factfiles/250.shtml\", \"title\": \"Chaffinch\", \"publisher\": \"[[BBC]]\", \"accessdate\": \"2008-03-26\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20080429125218/http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/wildfacts/factfiles/250.shtml\", \"archivedate\": \"2008-04-29\", \"work\": \"Science & Nature:Animals\"} Taxonomically, there are no officially recognized subspecies of chaffinch within Belgium.\n\nCaribbean and South American-based contests\nSpeed-singing contests for finches are also a common event in Guyana, Trinidad, Suriname and Brazil. The male finches are placed in cages on poles about one foot apart. The first finch to reach 50 songs wins. The illegal importation of these finches from immigrants of these countries has challenged authorities in New York City.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/02/nyregion/tiny-birds-big-drama-inside-the-world-of-the-birdmen-of-queens.html\", \"title\": \"Tiny Birds, Big Drama: Inside the World of the Birdmen of Queens\", \"last\": \"Rueb\", \"first\": \"Emily S.\", \"date\": \"July 31, 2015\", \"work\": \"www.nytimes.com\"}{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.thesmokinggun.com/buster/finches/bird-smuggle-thwarted-496015\", \"title\": \"Feds: Air Traveler Caught Trying To Smuggle 70 Birds Into U.S.\", \"date\": \"December 12, 2018\", \"work\": \"www.thesmokinggun.com\"}\n\nCheating incidents\nAs with other sports, vinkensport has had its cheating scandals, as well as accusations of artificial enhancement. One finch sang a record 1,278 susk-e-weits in one hour, and the owner was later accused of doping the bird with testosterone.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"May 21, 2007\", \"title\": \"One-Ounce Belgian Idols Vie for Most Tweets per Hour\", \"work\": \"[[The New York Times]]\", \"publisher\": \"The New York Times Company\", \"accessdate\": \"2007-05-23\", \"first\": \"Bilefsky\", \"last\": \"Dan\"} After one contestant sang exactly the same number of calls in three rounds, the box was opened and a mini CD player was discovered within.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"May 21, 2007\", \"title\": \"One-Ounce Belgian Idols Vie for Most Tweets per Hour\", \"work\": \"[[The New York Times]]\", \"publisher\": \"The New York Times Company\", \"accessdate\": \"2007-05-23\", \"first\": \"Bilefsky\", \"last\": \"Dan\"}\n\nOpposition to the sport\n...Blinded ere yet a-wing\nBy the red-hot needle thou,\nI stand and wonder how,\nSo zestfully thou canst sing!\nResenting not such wrong,\nThy grievous pain forgot,\nEternal dark thy lot,\nGroping thy whole life long;\nAfter that stab of fire;\nEnjailed in pitiless wire...\nThroughout much of its history, certain attributes of the sport have garnered criticism.
