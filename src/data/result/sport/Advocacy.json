Advocacy includes activities and publications to influence public policy, laws and budgets by using facts, their relationships, the media, and messaging to educate government officials and the public. Advocacy can include many activities that a person or organization undertakes including media campaigns, public speaking, commissioning and publishing research. Lobbying (often by lobby groups) is a form of advocacy where a direct approach is made to legislators on a specific issue or specific piece of legislation.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.npaction.org/article/articleview/76/1/248\", \"title\": \"Lobbying Versus Advocacy: Legal Definitions\", \"publisher\": \"NP Action\", \"accessdate\": \"2010-03-02\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20100402225054/http://www.npaction.org/article/articleview/76/1/248\", \"archivedate\": \"2 April 2010\"} Research[whose?] has started to address how advocacy groups in the United States{\"citetype\": \"journal\", \"title\": \"Advocacy 2.0: An analysis of how advocacy groups in the United States perceive and use social media as tools for facilitating civic engagement and collective action\", \"journal\": \"Journal of Information Policy\", \"last \": \"Obar\", \"first \": \"J.A.\", \"author2\": \"Zube, P.\", \"author3\": \"Lampe, C.\", \"year \": \"2012\", \"volume \": \"2\", \"pages \": \"1\\u201325\", \"ssrn \": \"1956352\"} and Canada{\"citetype\": \"journal\", \"date\": \"4 December 2014\", \"title\": \"Canadian Advocacy 2.0: A Study of Social Media Use by Social Movement Groups and Activists in Canada\", \"ssrn\": \"2254742\", \"last\": \"Obar\", \"first\": \"Jonathan\"} are using social media to facilitate civic engagement and collective action.\nAn advocate is someone who provides advocacy support to people who need it.[citation needed]\n\nForms\nThere are several forms of advocacy, each representing a different approach in a way to initiate changes in the society. One of the most popular forms is social justice advocacy.[according to whom?]\nThe initial definition does not encompass the notions of power relations, people's participation and a vision of a just society as promoted by social justice advocates. For them, advocacy represents the series of actions taken and issues highlighted to change the \u201cwhat is\u201d into a \u201cwhat should be\u201d, considering that this \u201cwhat should be\u201d is a more decent and a more just society (ib., 2001.)[full citation needed] Those actions, which vary with the political, economic and social environment in which they are conducted, have several points in common (ib., 2001.)[full citation needed] They:\nOther forms of advocacy include:\nDifferent contexts in which advocacy is used:\n\nTactics\nMargaret E.

It has been argued that the Internet helps to increase the speed, reach and effectiveness of advocacy-related communication as well as mobilization efforts, suggesting that social media are beneficial to the advocacy community.{\"citetype\": \"journal\", \"date\": \"4 December 2014\", \"title\": \"Canadian Advocacy 2.0: A Study of Social Media Use by Social Movement Groups and Activists in Canada\", \"ssrn\": \"2254742\", \"last\": \"Obar\", \"first\": \"Jonathan\"}{\"citetype\": \"journal\", \"year\": \"1999\", \"title\": \"From the Streets to the Internet: The Cyber-Diffusion of Contention\", \"journal\": \"Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science\", \"volume\": \"566\", \"pages\": \"132\\u2013143\", \"last\": \"Ope\", \"first\": \"J.A.M.\"}{\"citetype\": \"journal\", \"year\": \"2010\", \"title\": \"Manufacturing Community in an Online Activity Organization: The Rhetoric of MoveOn.org's E-mails\", \"journal\": \"Information, Communication and Society\", \"volume\": \"13\", \"issue\": \"2\", \"pages\": \"174\\u2013192\", \"last\": \"Eaton\", \"first\": \"M.\"}{\"citetype\": \"journal\", \"title\": \"Advocacy 2.0: An analysis of how advocacy groups in the United States perceive and use social media as tools for facilitating civic engagement and collective action\", \"journal\": \"Journal of Information Policy\", \"last \": \"Obar\", \"first \": \"J.A.\", \"author2\": \"Zube, P.\", \"author3\": \"Lampe, C.\", \"year \": \"2012\", \"volume \": \"2\", \"pages \": \"1\\u201325\", \"ssrn \": \"1956352\"}\n\nOther examples\nAdvocacy activities may include conducting an exit poll or the filing of an amicus brief.\n\nTopics\nPeople advocate for a large number and variety of topics. Some of these are clear-cut social issues that are universally agreed to be problematic and worth solving, such as human trafficking. Others\u2014such as abortion\u2014are much more divisive and inspire strongly-held opinions on both sides. There may never be a consensus on this latter type of issues, but intense advocacy is likely to remain. In the United States, any issue of widespread debate and deeply-divided opinion can be referred to as a social issue. The Library of Congress has assembled an extensive list of social issues in the United States, ranging from vast ones like abortion to same-sex marriage to smaller ones like hacking and academic cheating.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/toc/ecip0516/2005018778.html\", \"title\": \"Table of contents for Social issues in America\"}\nTopics that appear to involve advancing a certain positive ideal are often known as causes. A particular cause may be very expansive in nature \u2014 for instance, increasing liberty or fixing a broken political system.

The core existence of networks such as World Advocacy or the Advocacy Institute demonstrates the increasing importance of transnational advocacy and international advocacy. Transnational advocacy networks are more likely to emerge around issues where external influence is necessary to ease the communication between internal groups and their own government. Groups of advocates willing to further their mission also tend to promote networks and to meet with their internal counterparts to exchange ideas.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"last1\": \"Keck\", \"first1\": \"Margaret E.\", \"last2\": \"Sikkink\", \"first2\": \"Kathryn\", \"date\": \"1998\", \"title\": \"Activists beyond Borders Advocacy Networks in International Politics\", \"publisher\": \"Cornell University Press\", \"page\": \"16\", \"isbn\": \"978-0-8014-7129-2\"}\nTransnational advocacy is increasingly playing a role in advocacy for migrants rights, and migrant advocacy organizations have strategically called upon governments and international organizations for leverage.{\"citetype\": \"journal\", \"last1\": \"Kremers\", \"first1\": \"Daniel\", \"date\": \"2014\", \"title\": \"Transnational Migrant Advocacy From Japan: Tipping the Scales in the Policy-making Process\", \"url\": \"https://pacificaffairs.ubc.ca/articles/transnational-migrant-advocacy-from-japan-tipping-the-scales-in-the-policy-making-process/\", \"journal\": \"Pacific Affairs\", \"volume\": \"87\", \"issue\": \"4\", \"page\": \"733\", \"doi\": \"10.5509/2014874715\"}\nTransnational advocates spend time with local interest groups in order to better understand their views and wishes.[citation needed]\n",
