    "content": "Bandy\n\nBandy is a team winter sport played on ice, in which skaters use sticks to direct a ball into the opposing team's goal.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYyN8q44mX8\", \"title\": \"Edsbyn Sandviken SM \\u2013 Final in Upssala\", \"publisher\": \"YouTube\", \"accessdate\": \"7 February 2014\"}\nThe sport is considered a form of hockey and has a common background with ice hockey and field hockey. Bandy has also been influenced by the rules of association football: both games are normally played in halves of 45 minutes, there are 11 players on each team, and the fields in both games are about the same size. Bandy is played, like ice hockey, on ice but players use bowed sticks and a small ball, as in field hockey.\nA variant of bandy, rink bandy, is played to the same rules but on a field the size of an ice hockey rink, with ice hockey goal cages and with six players on each team, or five in USA Rink Bandy League. Traditional eleven-a-side bandy and rink bandy are recognized by the International Olympic Committee. More informal varieties also exist, like seven-a-side bandy with normally sized goal cages but without corner strokes. Those rules were applied at Davos Cup in 2016.\nRink bandy has in turn led to the creation of the sport rinkball. Bandy is also the predecessor of floorball, which was invented when people started playing with plastic bandy-shaped sticks and lightweight balls when running on the floors of indoor gym halls.\nBased on the number of participating athletes, bandy is the world's second-most participated winter sport after ice hockey.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://worldbandy.com/news/bandy-versus-the-50-olympic-winter-games-disciplines/\", \"title\": \"Bandy versus the 50 Olympic Winter Games Disciplines\", \"date\": \"4 December 2015\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20151222141905/http://worldbandy.com/news/bandy-versus-the-50-olympic-winter-games-disciplines/\", \"archivedate\": \"22 December 2015\", \"urlstatus \": \"dead\"}{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.worldbandy.com/newspost_7640.html\", \"title\": \"Bandy destined for the Olympic Winter Games!\", \"date\": \"21 October 2016\", \"publisher\": \"Federation of International Bandy\", \"accessdate\": \"15 January 2017\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20181017132109/http://www.worldbandy.com/newspost_7640.html\", \"archivedate\": \"17 October 2018\", \"urlstatus \": \"dead\"}[5] Bandy is also ranked as the number two winter sport in terms of tickets sold per day of competitions at the sport's world championship.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.worldbandy.com/newspost_7640.html\", \"title\": \"Bandy destined for the Olympic Winter Games!\", \"date\": \"21 October 2016\", \"publisher\": \"Federation of International Bandy\", \"accessdate\": \"15 January 2017\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20181017132109/http://www.worldbandy.com/newspost_7640.html\", \"archivedate\": \"17 October 2018\", \"urlstatus \": \"dead\"}\nHowever, compared with the seven Winter Olympic sports, bandy's popularity compared to that of other winter sports across the globe is considered by the International Olympic Committee to represent a \"gap between popularity and participation and global audiences.\" This is held to constitute a roadblock to future Olympic inclusion.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1061027/new-sports-face-struggle-to-be-added-to-winter-olympic-games-programme-ioc-warn\", \"title\": \"New sports face struggle to be added to Winter Olympic Games programme, IOC warn\", \"last\": \"Butler\", \"first\": \"Nick\", \"date\": \"4 February 2018\", \"website\": \"Insidethegames.biz\", \"publisher\": \"Dunsar Media\", \"accessdate\": \"17 June 2018\"}\n\nBackground\nThe earliest origin of the sport is debated.

Large expanses of ice would form on the flooded meadows or shallow washes in cold winters, and skating has been a tradition.

The first international match took place in 1891 between Bury Fen and the then Haarlemsche Hockey & Bandy Club from the Netherlands (a club which after a couple of club fusions now is named HC Bloemendaal). The same year, the National Bandy Association was started in England.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://iof1.idrottonline.se/SvenskaBandyforbundet/Bandy-Sverige/SvenskaBandyforbundet/Historikochstatistik/Historiskamilstolpar/Bandyhistoria1875-1919/\", \"title\": \"Svenska Bandyf\\u00f6rbundet, bandyhistoria 1875\\u20131919\", \"date\": \"1 February 2013\", \"publisher\": \"Iof1.idrottonline.se\", \"accessdate\": \"9 April 2014\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20131019151140/http://iof1.idrottonline.se/SvenskaBandyforbundet/Bandy-Sverige/SvenskaBandyforbundet/Historikochstatistik/Historiskamilstolpar/Bandyhistoria1875-1919/\", \"archivedate\": \"19 October 2013\"}\nThe match later dubbed \"the original bandy match\", was actually held in 1875 at The Crystal Palace in London.

While modern ice hockey was created in Canada, a game more similar to bandy was played initially, after British soldiers introduced the game in the late 19th century. At the same time as modern ice hockey rules were formalized in British North America (present day Canada), bandy rules were formulated in Europe. A cross between English and Russian bandy rules eventually developed, with the football-inspired English rules dominant, together with the Russian low border along most of the two sidelines, and this is the basis of the present sport since the 1950s.\nBefore Canadians introduced ice hockey into Europe in the early 20th century, \"hockey\" was another name for bandy,[14] and still is in parts of Russia and Kazakhstan.\nWith football and bandy being dominant sports in parts of Europe, it was common for sports clubs to have bandy and football sections, with athletes playing both sports at different times of the year. Some examples are English Nottingham Forest Football and Bandy Club (today known just as Nottingham Forest F.C.) and Norwegian Str\u00f8msgodset IF and Mj\u00f8ndalen IF, with the latter still having an active bandy section. In Sweden, most football clubs which were active during the first half of the 20th century also played bandy. Later, as the season for each sport increased in time, it was not as easy for the players to engage in both sports, so some clubs came to concentrate on one or the other. Many old clubs still have both sports on their program.\nBoth bandy and ice hockey were played in Europe during the 20th century, especially in Sweden, Finland, and Norway.[15] Ice hockey became more popular than bandy in most of Europe mostly because it had become an Olympic sport, while bandy had not. Athletes in Europe who had played bandy switched to ice hockey in the 1920s to compete in the Olympics.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://thehockeywriters.com/bandy-the-other-ice-hockey/\", \"title\": \"Bandy: The Other Ice Hockey\", \"date\": \"17 May 2013\", \"publisher\": \"The Hockey Writers\", \"accessdate\": \"6 May 2014\", \"author\": \"Eric Converse\"}{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.bandybond.nl/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/120-jaar-bandygeschiedenis-in-Nederland.pdf\", \"title\": \"120 jaar bandygeschiedenis in Nederland (1891\\u20132011)\", \"date\": \"7 March 2013\", \"page\": \"10\", \"accessdate\": \"13 February 2014\", \"author\": \"Arnout Janmaat\"} The smaller ice fields needed for ice hockey also made its rinks easier to maintain, especially in countries with short winters.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://thehockeywriters.com/bandy-the-other-ice-hockey/\", \"title\": \"Bandy: The Other Ice Hockey\", \"date\": \"17 May 2013\", \"publisher\": \"The Hockey Writers\", \"accessdate\": \"6 May 2014\", \"author\": \"Eric Converse\"}{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.cafebabel.co.uk/lifestyle/article/bandy-ice-hockey-in-sweden-goes-big-in-europe.html\", \"title\": \"Bandy \\u2013 ice hockey in Sweden goes big in Europe\", \"date\": \"12 November 2008\", \"publisher\": \"Caf\\u00e9 Babel\", \"accessdate\": \"6 May 2014\", \"author\": \"Waldemar Ingdahl\"} On the other hand, ice hockey was not played in the Soviet Union until the 1950s when the USSR wanted to compete internationally. The typical European style of ice hockey, with flowing, less physical play, represents a heritage of bandy.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://prohockeytalk.nbcsports.com/2014/02/14/russians-no-longer-mesmerize-with-brilliant-hockey-but-golden-feeling-is-there/\", \"title\": \"Russians no longer mesmerize with brilliant hockey but golden feeling is there\", \"date\": \"14 February 2014\", \"publisher\": \"NBC Sports Pro Hockey Talk\", \"accessdate\": \"21 February 2014\", \"author\": \"Joe Posnanski\"}\n\nNames of the sport\nThe sport's English name comes from the verb \"to bandy\", from the Middle French bander (\"to strike back and forth\"), and originally referred to a 17th-century Irish game similar to field hockey. The curved stick was also called a \"bandy\".[20] The etymological connection to the similarly named Welsh hockey game of bando is not clear.\nAn old name for bandy is hockey on the ice; in the first rule books from England at the turn of the Century 1900, the sport is literally called \"bandy or hockey on the ice\".[21] Since the mid-20th century the term bandy is usually preferred to prevent confusion with ice hockey.\nThe sport is known as bandy in many languages though there are a few notable exceptions.[22] In Russian bandy is called \"Russian hockey\" (\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0445\u043e\u043a\u043a\u0435\u0439) or more frequently, and officially, \"hockey with a ball\" (x\u043e\u043a\u043a\u0435\u0439 \u0441 \u043c\u044f\u0447\u043e\u043c) while ice hockey is called \"hockey with a puck\" (x\u043e\u043a\u043a\u0435\u0439 \u0441 \u0448\u0430\u0439\u0431\u043e\u0439) or more frequently just \"hockey\". If the context makes it clear that bandy is the subject, it as well can be called just \"hockey\". In Belarusian, Ukrainian and Bulgarian it is also called \"hockey with a ball\" (\u0445\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0439 \u0437 \u043c\u044f\u0447o\u043c, \u0445\u043e\u043a\u0435\u0439 \u0437 \u043c'\u044f\u0447\u0435\u043c and \u0445\u043e\u043a\u0435\u0439 \u0441 \u0442\u043e\u043f\u043a\u0430 respectively). In Slovak \"bandy hockey\" (bandyhokej) is the name. In Armenian, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Mongol and Uzbek, bandy is known as \"ball hockey\" (\u0563\u0576\u0564\u0561\u056f\u0578\u057e \u0570\u0578\u056f\u0565\u0575, \u0434\u043e\u043f\u0442\u044b \u0445\u043e\u043a\u043a\u0435\u0439, \u0442\u043e\u043f\u0442\u0443\u0443 \u0445\u043e\u043a\u043a\u0435\u0439, \u0431\u04e9\u043c\u0431\u04e9\u0433\u0442\u044d\u0439 \u0445\u043e\u043a\u043a\u0435\u0439 and koptokli xokkey respectively). In Finnish the two sports are distinguished as \"ice ball\" (j\u00e4\u00e4pallo) and \"ice puck\" (j\u00e4\u00e4kiekko), as well as in Hungarian (j\u00e9glabda; j\u00e9gkorong), although in Hungarian it is more often called \"bandy\" nowadays. In Estonian bandy is also called \"ice ball\" (j\u00e4\u00e4pall). In Mandarin Chinese it is \"bandy ball\" (\u73ed\u8fea\u7403). In Scottish Gaelic the name is \"ice shinty\" (camanachd-deighe).{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.faclair.com/?txtSearch=camanachd-deighe\", \"title\": \"Am Faclair Beag - Scottish Gaelic Dictionary\", \"website\": \"www.faclair.com\"} In old times shinty or shinney were also sometimes used in English for bandy.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://archive.org/details/skatings00heatrich\", \"title\": \"Skating\", \"last2\": \"Tebbutt\", \"first2\": \"C.

Opposing players may try to regain control of the ball by intercepting a pass or through tackling the opponent who controls the ball. However, physical contact between opponents is limited. Bandy is generally a free-flowing game, with play stopping only when the ball has left the field of play, or when play is stopped by the referee. After a stoppage, play can recommence with a free stroke, a penalty shot or a corner stroke. If the ball has left the field along the sidelines, the referee must decide which team touched the ball last, and award a restart stroke to the opposing team, just like football's throw-in.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.worldbandy.com/ckfinder/userfiles/files/Rules/Bandyrules_FIB_Sept2011.pdf\", \"title\": \"Bandy Playing Rules\", \"date\": \"1 September 2011\", \"accessdate\": \"25 March 2014\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20130511181936/http://www.worldbandy.com/ckfinder/userfiles/files/Rules/Bandyrules_FIB_Sept2011.pdf\", \"archivedate\": \"11 May 2013\", \"work\": \"Federation of International Bandy\", \"urlstatus \": \"dead\"}\nThe rules do not specify any player positions other than goalkeeper,{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.worldbandy.com/ckfinder/userfiles/files/Rules/Bandyrules_FIB_Sept2011.pdf\", \"title\": \"Bandy Playing Rules\", \"date\": \"1 September 2011\", \"accessdate\": \"25 March 2014\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20130511181936/http://www.worldbandy.com/ckfinder/userfiles/files/Rules/Bandyrules_FIB_Sept2011.pdf\", \"archivedate\": \"11 May 2013\", \"work\": \"Federation of International Bandy\", \"urlstatus \": \"dead\"} but a number of player specialisations have evolved. Broadly, these include three main categories: forwards, whose main task is to score goals; defenders, who specialise in preventing their opponents from scoring; and midfielders, who take the ball from the opposition and pass it to the forwards. Players in these positions are referred to as outfield players, to discern them from the single goalkeeper. These positions are further differentiated by which side of the field the player spends most time in. For example, there are central defenders, and left and right midfielders. The ten outfield players may be arranged in these positions in any combination (for example, there may be three defenders, five midfielders, and two forwards), and the number of players in each position determines the style of the team's play; more forwards and fewer defenders would create a more aggressive and offensive-minded game, while the reverse would create a slower, more defensive style of play. While players may spend most of the game in a specific position, there are few restrictions on player movement, and players can switch positions at any time. The layout of the players on the pitch is called the team's formation, and defining the team's formation and tactics is usually the prerogative of the team's manager(s).\n\nRules\nThere are eighteen rules in official play, designed to apply to all levels of bandy, although certain modifications for groups such as juniors, veterans or women are permitted. The rules are often framed in broad terms, which allow flexibility in their application depending on the nature of the game.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.worldbandy.com/ckfinder/userfiles/files/Rules/Bandyrules_FIB_Sept2011.pdf\", \"title\": \"Bandy Playing Rules\", \"date\": \"1 September 2011\", \"accessdate\": \"25 March 2014\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20130511181936/http://www.worldbandy.com/ckfinder/userfiles/files/Rules/Bandyrules_FIB_Sept2011.pdf\", \"archivedate\": \"11 May 2013\", \"work\": \"Federation of International Bandy\", \"urlstatus \": \"dead\"}\nThe Bandy Playing Rules can be found on the official website of the Federation of International Bandy,{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.worldbandy.com/ckfinder/userfiles/files/Rules/Bandyrules_FIB_Sept2011.pdf\", \"title\": \"Bandy Playing Rules\", \"date\": \"1 September 2011\", \"accessdate\": \"25 March 2014\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20130511181936/http://www.worldbandy.com/ckfinder/userfiles/files/Rules/Bandyrules_FIB_Sept2011.pdf\", \"archivedate\": \"11 May 2013\", \"work\": \"Federation of International Bandy\", \"urlstatus \": \"dead\"} and are overseen by the Rules and Referee Committee.\nEach team consists of a maximum of 11 players (excluding substitutes), one of whom must be the goalkeeper. A team of fewer than eight players may not start a game. Goalkeepers are the only players allowed to play the ball with their hands or arms, and they are only allowed to do so within the penalty area in front of their own goal.[26]\nThough there are a variety of positions in which the outfield (non-goalkeeper) players are strategically placed by a coach, these positions are not defined or required by the rules of the game.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.worldbandy.com/ckfinder/userfiles/files/Rules/Bandyrules_FIB_Sept2011.pdf\", \"title\": \"Bandy Playing Rules\", \"date\": \"1 September 2011\", \"accessdate\": \"25 March 2014\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20130511181936/http://www.worldbandy.com/ckfinder/userfiles/files/Rules/Bandyrules_FIB_Sept2011.pdf\", \"archivedate\": \"11 May 2013\", \"work\": \"Federation of International Bandy\", \"urlstatus \": \"dead\"}\nThe positions and formations of the players in bandy are virtually the same as the common association football positions and the same terms are used for the different positions of the players. A team usually consists of defenders, midfielders and forwards. The defenders can play in the form of centre-backs, full-backs and sometimes wing-backs, midfielders playing in the centre, attacking or defensive, and forwards in the form of centre forward, second strikers and sometimes a winger. Sometimes one player is also taking up the role of a libero.\nAny number of players may be replaced by substitutes during the course of the game. Substitutions can be performed without notifying the referee and can be performed while the ball is in play. However, if the substitute enters the ice before his teammate has left it, this will result in a five-minute ban. A team can bring at the most four substitutes to the game and one of these is likely to be an extra goalkeeper.[26]\nA game is officiated by a referee, the authority and enforcer of the rules, whose decisions are final. The referee may have one or two assistant referees. A secretary outside of the field often takes care of the match protocol.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.worldbandy.com/ckfinder/userfiles/files/Rules/Bandyrules_FIB_Sept2011.pdf\", \"title\": \"Bandy Playing Rules\", \"date\": \"1 September 2011\", \"accessdate\": \"25 March 2014\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20130511181936/http://www.worldbandy.com/ckfinder/userfiles/files/Rules/Bandyrules_FIB_Sept2011.pdf\", \"archivedate\": \"11 May 2013\", \"work\": \"Federation of International Bandy\", \"urlstatus \": \"dead\"}\nThe basic equipment players are required to wear includes a pair of Bandy skates, a helmet, a mouth guard and, in the case of the goalkeeper, a face guard.\nThe teams must wear uniforms that make it easy to distinguish the two teams. The goal keeper wears distinct colours to single him out from his or her teammates, just as in football. The skates, sticks and any tape on the stick must be of another colour than the bandy ball, which shall be orange or cerise.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.worldbandy.com/ckfinder/userfiles/files/Rules/Bandyrules_FIB_Sept2011.pdf\", \"title\": \"Bandy Playing Rules\", \"date\": \"1 September 2011\", \"accessdate\": \"25 March 2014\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20130511181936/http://www.worldbandy.com/ckfinder/userfiles/files/Rules/Bandyrules_FIB_Sept2011.pdf\", \"archivedate\": \"11 May 2013\", \"work\": \"Federation of International Bandy\", \"urlstatus \": \"dead\"}\nIn addition to the aforementioned, various protections are used to protect knees, elbows, genitals and throat. The pants and gloves may contain padding.\nThe stick used in bandy is an essential part of the sport. It should be made of an approved material such as wood or a similar material and should not contain any metal or sharp parts which can hurt the surrounding players. Sticks are crooked and are available in five angles, where 1 has the smallest bend and 5 has the most. Bend 4 is the most common size in professional bandy. The bandy stick should not have similar colours to the ball, such as orange or pink; it should be no longer than 127 centimetres (50\u00a0in), and no wider than 7 centimetres (2.8\u00a0in).{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.worldbandy.com/ckfinder/userfiles/files/Rules/Equipment2012.pdf\", \"title\": \"Federation of International Bandy\", \"format\": \"PDF\", \"accessdate\": \"7 February 2014\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20130511163826/http://www.worldbandy.com/ckfinder/userfiles/files/Rules/Equipment2012.pdf\", \"archivedate\": \"11 May 2013\", \"urlstatus \": \"dead\"}\nA bandy field is 45\u201365 metres (148\u2013213\u00a0ft) by 90\u2013110 metres (300\u2013360\u00a0ft), a total of 4,050\u20137,150 square metres (43,600\u201377,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft), or about the same size as a football pitch and considerably larger than an ice hockey rink. Along the sidelines a 15\u00a0cm (6\u00a0in) high border (vant, sarg, wand, wall) is placed to prevent the ball from leaving the ice. It should not be attached to the ice, to glide upon collisions, and should end 1\u20133 metres (3\u00a0ft 3\u00a0in\u20139\u00a0ft 10\u00a0in) away from the corners.\nCentered at each shortline is a 3.5\u00a0m (11\u00a0ft) wide and 2.1\u00a0m (6\u00a0ft 11\u00a0in) high goal cage and in front of the cage is a half-circular penalty area with a 17\u00a0m (56\u00a0ft) radius.

A centre-line is drawn through the centre spot parallel with the shortlines.\nAt each of the corners, a 1\u00a0m (3\u00a0ft 3\u00a0in) radius quarter-circle is drawn, and a dotted line is painted parallel to the shortline and 5 metres (16\u00a0ft) away from it without extending into the penalty area. The dotted line can be replaced with a 0.5-metre (1\u00a0ft 8\u00a0in) long line starting at the edge of the penalty area and extending towards the sideline, 5 metres (16\u00a0ft) from the shortline.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.worldbandy.com/ckfinder/userfiles/files/Rules/Bandyrules_FIB_Sept2011.pdf\", \"title\": \"Bandy Playing Rules\", \"date\": \"1 September 2011\", \"accessdate\": \"25 March 2014\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20130511181936/http://www.worldbandy.com/ckfinder/userfiles/files/Rules/Bandyrules_FIB_Sept2011.pdf\", \"archivedate\": \"11 May 2013\", \"work\": \"Federation of International Bandy\", \"urlstatus \": \"dead\"}\nA standard adult bandy match consists of two periods of 45 minutes each, known as halves. Each half runs continuously, meaning the clock is not stopped when the ball is out of play; the referee can, however, make allowance for time lost through significant stoppages as described below. There is usually a 15-minute half-time break. The end of the match is known as full-time.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.worldbandy.com/ckfinder/userfiles/files/Rules/Bandyrules_FIB_Sept2011.pdf\", \"title\": \"Bandy Playing Rules\", \"date\": \"1 September 2011\", \"accessdate\": \"25 March 2014\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20130511181936/http://www.worldbandy.com/ckfinder/userfiles/files/Rules/Bandyrules_FIB_Sept2011.pdf\", \"archivedate\": \"11 May 2013\", \"work\": \"Federation of International Bandy\", \"urlstatus \": \"dead\"}\nThe referee is the official timekeeper for the match, and may make an allowance for time lost through substitutions, injured players requiring attention, or other stoppages. This added time is commonly referred to as stoppage time or injury time, and must be reported to the match secretary and the two captains. The referee alone signals the end of the match.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.worldbandy.com/ckfinder/userfiles/files/Rules/Bandyrules_FIB_Sept2011.pdf\", \"title\": \"Bandy Playing Rules\", \"date\": \"1 September 2011\", \"accessdate\": \"25 March 2014\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20130511181936/http://www.worldbandy.com/ckfinder/userfiles/files/Rules/Bandyrules_FIB_Sept2011.pdf\", \"archivedate\": \"11 May 2013\", \"work\": \"Federation of International Bandy\", \"urlstatus \": \"dead\"}\nIf it is very cold or if it is snowing, the match can be broken into thirds of 30 minutes each. At the extremely cold 1999 World Championship some matches were played in four periods of 15 minutes each and with extra long breaks in between. In the World Championships the two halves can be 30 minutes each for the nations in the B division.\nIn league competitions games may end in a draw, but in some knockout competitions if a game is tied at the end of regulation time it may go into extra time, which consists of two further 15-minute periods. If the score is still tied after extra time, the game will be replayed. As an alternative, the extra two times 15-minutes may be played as \"golden goal\" which means the first team that scores during the extra-time wins the game. If both extra periods are played without a scored goal, a penalty shootout will settle the game. The teams shoot five penalties each and if this doesn't settle the game, the teams shoot one more penalty each until one of them misses and the other scores.\nUnder the rules, the two basic states of play during a game are ball in play and ball out of play. From the beginning of each playing period with a stroke-off (a set strike from the centre-spot by one team) until the end of the playing period, the ball is in play at all times, except when either the ball leaves the field of play, or play is stopped by the referee. When the ball becomes out of play, play is restarted by one of six restart methods depending on how it went out of play:\nIf the time runs out while a team is preparing for a free-stroke or penalty, the strike should still be made but it must go into the goal by one shot to count as a goal. Similarly, a goal made via a corner stroke should be allowed, but it must be executed using only one shot in addition to the strike needed to put the ball in play.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.worldbandy.com/ckfinder/userfiles/files/Rules/Bandyrules_FIB_Sept2011.pdf\", \"title\": \"Bandy Playing Rules\", \"date\": \"1 September 2011\", \"accessdate\": \"25 March 2014\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20130511181936/http://www.worldbandy.com/ckfinder/userfiles/files/Rules/Bandyrules_FIB_Sept2011.pdf\", \"archivedate\": \"11 May 2013\", \"work\": \"Federation of International Bandy\", \"urlstatus \": \"dead\"}\nFree-strokes can be awarded to a team if a player of the opposite team breaks any rule, for example, by hitting with the stick against the opponent's stick or skates. Free-strokes can also be awarded upon incorrect execution of corner-strikes, free-strikes, goal-throws, and so on. or the use of incorrect equipment, such as a broken stick.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.worldbandy.com/ckfinder/userfiles/files/Rules/Bandyrules_FIB_Sept2011.pdf\", \"title\": \"Bandy Playing Rules\", \"date\": \"1 September 2011\", \"accessdate\": \"25 March 2014\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20130511181936/http://www.worldbandy.com/ckfinder/userfiles/files/Rules/Bandyrules_FIB_Sept2011.pdf\", \"archivedate\": \"11 May 2013\", \"work\": \"Federation of International Bandy\", \"urlstatus \": \"dead\"}\nRather than stopping play, the referee may allow play to continue when its continuation will benefit the team against which an offence has been committed. This is known as \"playing an advantage\". The referee may \"call back\" play and penalise the original offence if the anticipated advantage does not ensue within a short period of time, typically taken to be four to five seconds. Even if an offence is not penalised because the referee plays an advantage, the offender may still be sanctioned (see below) for any associated misconduct at the next stoppage of play.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.worldbandy.com/ckfinder/userfiles/files/Rules/Bandyrules_FIB_Sept2011.pdf\", \"title\": \"Bandy Playing Rules\", \"date\": \"1 September 2011\", \"accessdate\": \"25 March 2014\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20130511181936/http://www.worldbandy.com/ckfinder/userfiles/files/Rules/Bandyrules_FIB_Sept2011.pdf\", \"archivedate\": \"11 May 2013\", \"work\": \"Federation of International Bandy\", \"urlstatus \": \"dead\"}\nIf a defender violently attacks an opponent within the penalty area, a penalty shot is awarded. Certain other offences, when carried out within the penalty area, result in a penalty shot provided there is a goal situation. These include a defender holding or hooking an attacker, or blocking a goal situation with a lifted skate, thrown stick or glove and so on. Also, the defenders (with the exception of the goal-keeper) are not allowed to kneel or lie on the ice. The final offences that might mandate a penalty shot are those of hitting or blocking an opponent's stick or touching the ball with the hands, arms, stick or head. If any of these actions is carried out in a non-goal situation, they shall be awarded with a free-stroke from one of the free-stroke spots at the penalty area line. A penalty shot should always be accompanied by a 5 or 10 minutes penalty (see below). If the penalty results in a goal, the penalty should be considered personal meaning that a substitute can be sent in for the penalised player. This does not apply in the event of a red card (see below).{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.worldbandy.com/ckfinder/userfiles/files/Rules/Bandyrules_FIB_Sept2011.pdf\", \"title\": \"Bandy Playing Rules\", \"date\": \"1 September 2011\", \"accessdate\": \"25 March 2014\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20130511181936/http://www.worldbandy.com/ckfinder/userfiles/files/Rules/Bandyrules_FIB_Sept2011.pdf\", \"archivedate\": \"11 May 2013\", \"work\": \"Federation of International Bandy\", \"urlstatus \": \"dead\"}\nA ten-minute penalty is indicated through the use of a blue card and can be caused by protesting or behaving incorrectly, attacking an opponent violently or stopping the ball incorrectly to get an advantage.\nThe third time a player receives a penalty, it will be a personal penalty, meaning he or she will miss the remainder of the match. A substitute can enter the field after five or ten minutes. A full game penalty can be received upon using abusive language or directly attacking an opponent and means that the player can neither play nor be substituted for the remainder of the game. A match penalty is indicated through the use of a red card.\nThe offside rule effectively limits the ability of attacking players to remain forward (i.e. closer to the opponent's goal-line) of the ball, the second-to-last defending player (which can include the goalkeeper), and the half-way line. This rule is in effect just like that of soccer.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.worldbandy.com/ckfinder/userfiles/files/Rules/Bandyrules_FIB_Sept2011.pdf\", \"title\": \"Bandy Playing Rules\", \"date\": \"1 September 2011\", \"accessdate\": \"25 March 2014\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20130511181936/http://www.worldbandy.com/ckfinder/userfiles/files/Rules/Bandyrules_FIB_Sept2011.pdf\", \"archivedate\": \"11 May 2013\", \"work\": \"Federation of International Bandy\", \"urlstatus \": \"dead\"}\n\nInternational federation\nThe Federation of International Bandy (FIB) has had 33 members at most.

In 2004, FIB was fully accepted by IOC.\nFIB is now a member of Association of IOC Recognised International Sports Federations.\n\nWorld Championships\nThe Bandy World Championship for men is arranged by the FIB and was first held in 1957. It was held every two years starting in 1961, and every year since 2003. Currently the record number of countries participating in the World Championships is twenty (2019). Since the number of countries playing bandy is not large, every country which can set up a team is welcome to take part in the World Championship. The quality of the teams varies; however, with only six nations, Sweden, the Soviet Union, Russia, Finland, Norway, and Kazakhstan, having won medals (allowing for the fact that Russia's team took over from the Soviet Union in 1993). Finland won the 2004 world championship in V\u00e4ster\u00e5s, Sweden, while all other championships have been won by Sweden, the Soviet Union and Russia.\nIn February 2004, Sweden won the first World Championship for women, hosted in Finland, without conceding a goal. In the 2014 women's World Championship Russia won, for the first time toppling the Swedes from the throne. In 2016 Sweden took the title back. In 2018 the tournament was played in a totally Asian country for the first time when Chengde in China hosted it.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://translate.google.co.uk/translate?hl=en&sl=ru&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rusbandy.ru%2Fnews%2F8728\", \"title\": \"Google Translate\"}{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=zh-CN&tl=en&u=http://www.hrbipe.edu.cn/html/JSXL/YXYDY/show-21181.html\", \"title\": \"Google Translate\"}\nThe same goes for the men's tournament (the area north and west of the Ural River is located in Europe, thus Kazakhstan is a transcontinental country), when Harbin hosted the 2018 Division B tournament.\nThere are also Youth Bandy World Championships in different age groups for boys and young men and in one age group for girls. The oldest group is the under 23 championship, Bandy World Championship Y-23.\n\nOlympic Movement\nBandy is recognized by the International Olympic Committee, and was played as a demonstration sport at the 1952 Winter Olympics in Oslo. However, it has yet to officially be played at the Olympics.\nFIB president Boris Skrynnik lobbied for Bandy to be included in the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, given Russia's prominence in the sport.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"29 January 2010\", \"title\": \"It\\u2019s Not Hockey, It\\u2019s Bandy\", \"url\": \"https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/29/sports/olympics/29bandy.html\", \"work\": \"The New York Times\"} Members of the Chinese Olympic Committee were present at the 2017 world championships to meet with Skrynnik about the possibility of considering the sport for the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"title\": \"Bandy has chances to be included into 2022 Winter Olympics - FIB President\", \"url\": \"http://tass.com/sport/929068\", \"work\": \"TASS\", \"language\": \"EN\", \"accessdate\": \"7 August 2017\"}{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"29 February 2016\", \"title\": \"Bandy: How Sweden's little known sport is winning fans\", \"url\": \"https://www.thelocal.se/20160229/bandy-how-swedens-little-known-sport-is-winning-converts\", \"accessdate\": \"25 September 2016\", \"newspaper\": \"[[The Local]]\"} However, in 2018 it was announced no new sports would be added for 2022.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1061156/ioc-confirm-no-new-sports-will-be-added-to-beijing-2022-programme\", \"title\": \"IOC confirm no new sports will be added to Beijing 2022 programme\", \"last\": \"Butler\", \"first\": \"Nick\", \"date\": \"7 February 2018\", \"website\": \"Insidethegames.biz\", \"publisher\": \"Dunsar Media\", \"accessdate\": \"15 May 2018\"}\nCompared with the seven Winter Olympic sports, bandy's popularity across the globe is considered by the International Olympic Committee to have a, \"gap between popularity and participation and global audiences\", which is a roadblock into future Olympic inclusion.\n\nAsian Winter Games\nAt the 2011 Asian Winter Games, open to members of the Olympic Council of Asia, men's bandy was included for the first time.

The Swedes contributed largely, and clubs sprang up around the capital of Oslo. Oslo, including neighbouring towns, is still today the region where bandy enjoys most popularity in Norway.\nIn 1912 the Norwegians played their first National Championship, which was played annually up to 1940. During WWII, illegal bandy was played in hidden places in forests, on ponds and lakes. In 1943, \u221244 and \u221245, illegal championships were held. In 1946 legal play resumed and still goes on. After WWII the number of teams rose, as well as attendance which regularly were in the thousands, but mild winters in the 1970s and 80s shrunk the league, and in 2003 only five clubs (teams) fought out the 1st division with low attendance numbers and little media coverage.\nIn recent years, the number of artificially frozen pitches have increased in Norway, and more sports clubs have reinvigorated their bandy sections with new men's and youth teams. Because of this, as well as an increase of Swedish players in Norway, the competitiveness of the game has risen, especially in the first division Eliteserien.[citation needed] The adult men's game in Norway today consists of Eliteserien with eight teams, as well as three lower divisions. Bandy in Norway has also started to spread geographically, but some clubs in apart locations in the 3rd division only have access to ice hockey rinks and therefore play rink bandy for home games.[citation needed] Compared to the past, attendance is still fairly low, but important Eliteserien matches can attract around 1000 spectators.[citation needed]\nIn Russia bandy is known as hockey with a ball or simply Russian hockey. A similar game became popular among the Russian nobility in the early 1700s, with the imperial court of Peter the Great playing a predecessor of modern bandy on Saint Petersburg's frozen Neva river. Russians played this game using ordinary footwear, with sticks made out of juniper wood, only later were skates introduced. It was only in the second half of the 19th century that bandy became popular among the masses throughout the Russian Empire. Traditionally the Russians used a longer skate blade than other nations, giving them the advantage of skating faster. However, they would find it more difficult to turn quickly. A bandy skate has a longer blade than a hockey skate, and the \"Russian skate\" is even longer.\nWhen the Federation of International Bandy was formed in 1955, with the Soviet Union as one of its founding members, the Russians largely adopted the international rules of the game developed in England in the 19th century, with one notable exception. The other countries adopted the border.\nBandy is considered a national sport in Russia{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://eng.tatar-inform.ru/news/2011/01/21/33986/\", \"title\": \"Russian bandy players blessed for victory at world championship in Kazan\", \"date\": \"21 January 2011\", \"publisher\": \"Tatar-Inform\", \"accessdate\": \"31 August 2009\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20120424230703/http://eng.tatar-inform.ru/news/2011/01/21/33986/\", \"archivedate\": \"24 April 2012\", \"urlstatus \": \"dead\"} and is the only discipline to have official support of the Russian Orthodox Church.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=ru&u=http://www.rusbandy.ru/news/7591\", \"title\": \"Google Translate\"}\nThe Russian Bandy Super League is played every year and the winner in the final becomes Russian champion.

He talked, among other things, about the need to give more support to Russian bandy.[65] It was the first time a head of state had accepted a meeting to talk about Russian bandy.

The Swedish royal family, noblemen and diplomats were the first players. Swedish championships for men have been played annually since 1907. In the 1920s students played the game and it became a largely middle class sport. After Slottsbrons IF won the Swedish championship in 1934 it became popular amongst workers in the smaller industrial towns and villages. Bandy remains the main sport in many of these places.\nBandy in Sweden is famous for its \"culture\" \u2013 both playing bandy and being a spectator requires great fortitude and dedication. A \"bandy briefcase\u00a0[sv]\" is the classic accessory for spectating \u2013 it is typically made of brown leather, well worn and contains a warm drink in a thermos and/or a bottle of liquor.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"first \": \"Ingrid\", \"last \": \"Sundberg\", \"title \": \"Bandyportf\\u00f6ljens tid \\u00e4r h\\u00e4r\", \"url \": \"http://www.folket.se/folket/standard_article.php?id=139481&avdelning_1=101&avdelning_2=105&t=1373991006\", \"work \": \"Folket\", \"date \": \"10 November 2006\", \"accessdate \": \"7 January 2007\", \"language \": \"Swedish\", \"archiveurl \": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20070928181039/http://www.folket.se/folket/standard_article.php?id=139481&avdelning_1=101&avdelning_2=105&t=1373991006\", \"archivedate \": \"28 September 2007\"}\nBandy is most often played at outdoor arenas during winter time, so the need for spectators to carry flasks or thermoses of 'warming' liquid like gl\u00f6gg is a natural effect.\nA notable tradition is \"annandagsbandy\", bandy games played on Saint Stephen's Day, which for many Swedes is an important Christmas season tradition and always draws bigger crowds than usual.

From 1991 to 2012, it was played at Studenternas Idrottsplats in Uppsala, often drawing crowds in excess of 20,000. The reason the play-off match was set in Uppsala is because of IFK Uppsala's success in the beginning of the 20th century. IFK Uppsala won 11 titles in the Swedish Championships between 1907 and 1920, which made them the most successful bandy club in the entire country. Now, however, the record is held by V\u00e4ster\u00e5s SK. A contributing factor was the poor quality of the ice at S\u00f6derstadion, where the finals were held from 1967 to 1989.\nIn 2013 and 2014 the final was played indoors in Friends Arena, the national stadium for football in Solna, Stockholm, with a retractable roof and a capacity of 50 000. The first final at Friends Arena in 2013 drew a record crowd of 38,474 when Hammarby IF Bandy, after ending up in second place in six finals during the 2000s, won their second title. Due to declining attendance since, for 2015 through 2017 Tele2 Arena in southern Stockholm was chosen as a new venue. However, the new indoor venue failed to attract much more than half of the total capacity.
