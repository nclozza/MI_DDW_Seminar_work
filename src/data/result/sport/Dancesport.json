In the case of wheelchair dancesport, at least one of the dancers is in a wheelchair.\nDancesport events are sanctioned and regulated by dancesport organizations at the national and international level, such as the World DanceSport Federation.\nThe name was invented to help competitive ballroom dancing gain Olympic recognition.[2] The physical demand of dancesport has been the subject of scientific research.[3][4][5][6]\n\nHistory\nThe first unofficial world championship took place in 1909,[7] and the first formation team[8] was presented in 1932 by Olive Ripman at the Astoria Ballroom, London.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.dancesportireland.org/about_dancesport.html\", \"title\": \"''History of Dancesport by Dancesport Ireland''\", \"accessdate\": \"2009-03-29\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20090106130437/http://www.dancesportireland.org/about_dancesport.html\", \"archivedate\": \"January 6, 2009\"}[9] Dancesport was first broadcast on TV in 1960.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"title \": \"''WDSF History''\", \"url \": \"http://www.worlddancesport.org/WDSF/History\", \"accessdate \": \"2011-08-25\"}\n\nStyles\nThe term dancesport  applies to the International Style{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"2000-09-22\", \"title\": \"Sweeping a dance floor near you\", \"work\": \"Austin American-Statesman\", \"page\": \"F1\", \"first\": \"Sondra\", \"last\": \"Lomax\"} as well the as American Style of competitive ballroom. It includes the following categories:\nThese categories apply to both individual couples and formation dance.\n\nWorld Dance Council\nThe World Dance Council (WDC) is a registered limited company, and the legal successor to the International Council of Ballroom Dancing (ICBD), which was formed in 1950 in Edinburgh.[7] The WDC operates through a general council and two committees:\nIn 2007 the WDC Amateur League was created.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.wdcamateurleague.com/news_detail.php?news_id=68\", \"title\": \"To All Competitors, Coaches/Trainers\", \"publisher\": \"World Dance Council - Amateur League\", \"accessdate\": \"2010-09-21\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20101219033602/http://www.wdcamateurleague.com/news_detail.php?news_id=68\", \"archivedate\": \"2010-12-19\"} This organisation runs a number of competitions and has its own world ranking system for amateur dancers.\nEach member country in the WDC has its own national organisation, such as the British Dance Council, which acts as a forum for the many interested parties in that country. The national bodies decide on their delegates to the WDC.\n\nWorld DanceSport Federation\nThe World DanceSport Federation (WDSF), formerly the International DanceSport Federation (IDSF), is the international governing body of dancesport, as recognised by the International Olympic Committee (IOC).\nFounded in 1957 as the International Council of Amateur Dancers (ICAD), it took up the name International DanceSport Federation in 1990. In 2011 it changed its name to World DanceSport Federation to emphasise the organization's global character.\nIn the past, the IDSF's focus was on administering amateur dancers and competitions. However, in 2010 the IDSF Professional Division was created (formerly known as the IPDSC), which extended this focus to professional dancesport.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"title \": \"''WDSF History''\", \"url \": \"http://www.worlddancesport.org/WDSF/History\", \"accessdate \": \"2011-08-25\"}\nWDSF members are only allowed to dance in competitions that are on the WDSF's official competition calendar, unless the member has obtained the WDSF's written permission to compete in an event that is not on the WDSF's calendar.[14]\n\nCompetitions\nThere are a wide variety of dance competitions. They range from the well known Blackpool Dance Festival, an event open to all, to competitions conducted exclusively for university students, such as those hosted by the Inter Varsity Dance Association{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.universitydancesport.com/\", \"title\": \"UK University Dancesport website\", \"accessdate\": \"13 August 2019\"} in the UK.\nAmateur competitions commonly include events that group dancers by age, experience, or both. For example, events might group young dancers by age, such as: juvenile (<12yrs), junior (12-16yrs), and youth (16-19yrs). Events may sometimes cover a wide range of ages, with groupings such as: under 21yrs, adult, senior I (Over 35yrs), senior II (Over 45yrs), senior III (Over 55yrs, and senior IV (Over 65yrs).\nCompetitors may also be grouped by experience level, with categories such as Beginner, Novice, Intermediate, Pre-Amateur and Amateur. These generally correspond to the number of the dances to be performed in the competition, with Beginners performing one dance, and those at Amateur level performing five. In some competitions these are categorized into grades from A to E, with \"A\" the equivalent of the Amateur level, and \"E\" corresponding to the \"Beginner\" level.\n\nWDSF minimum competition dance area size standard\nWDSF governing bodies in different countries have the flexibility to decide on the dance area size for competitions held in the country.\nIn December 2011, the WDSF Open and the Australian Nationals were held at the Hisense Arena located within the Olympic park in Melbourne. The floor was at 84 by 37.7 meters which was 7.61 times the size of what WDSF requires.\n\nRules\nThe World Dance Council (WDC) rules for international competitions are lengthy and detailed.[16] The music for competitions is kept confidential until the event. The music always follows a strict tempo and, for a couples competition, it will have a duration of no less than 90 seconds, and no more than two minutes.\nSome elementary competitions are restricted to \"basic\" steps, but international competitions are open as to choreography, within the limits of the traditional style of the individual dances. Only the Viennese waltz has defined choreography: it is limited to seven well-specified figures. Lifts are not permitted, except for Show Dance titles. The tempo for each dance is defined. In the finals, couples are marked under the skating system and judged by timing, footwork, rise and fall, alignment, direction and floor craft. Competitors must meet World Anti-Doping Agency rules.\n\nDancesport as an Olympic event\nAfter a long campaign, the World DanceSport Federation (WDSF), formerly IDSF, was recognized by the International Olympic Committee as the sole representative body for dancesport, on September 5, 1997.[17][18] At that point, many dance organisations changed their titles to incorporate the word sport. This recognition gives the IDSF, potentially, a unique status. The WDSF website shows letters and certificates from the IOC that recognise dancesport as an eligible sport for inclusion pursuant to rule 29 of the Olympic Charter.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.idsf.net/index.tpl?id=29\", \"title\": \"''Official Letter from Mr. Juan Antonio Samaranch''\", \"accessdate\": \"2010-09-04\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20101013040944/http://www.idsf.net/index.tpl?id=29\", \"archivedate\": \"2010-10-13\"}\n{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"title \": \"''Official IOC Certificate''\", \"url \": \"http://www.idsf.net/index.tpl?id=30\", \"accessdate \": \"2010-09-04\", \"urlstatus \": \"dead\", \"archiveurl \": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20100626010044/http://www.idsf.net/index.tpl?id=30\", \"archivedate \": \"2010-06-26\"}\nOn its website, the IDSF gives an upbeat appraisal of the chances of dancesport being included in a future summer Olympic Games.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.idsf.net/press02/idsf0213.pdf\", \"title\": \"IOC: Green Light for DanceSport\", \"publisher\": \"International DanceSport Federation\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20041017132959/http://www.idsf.net/press02/idsf0213.pdf\", \"archivedate\": \"2004-10-17\"} However, dancesport has not been included as an official event at the Olympics since its recognition,{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.olympic.org/uk/organisation/if/fi_uk.asp?id_federation=43\", \"title\": \"International DanceSport Federation\", \"work\": \"Olympic.org - Official website of the Olympic Movement\", \"date \": \"2018-12-20\"} and there are many who doubt that it ever will.[23][24] The 2008 Beijing Olympics did not include ballroom dancing and neither did the 2012 London Olympics.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"title \": \"Olympic Sports London 2012\", \"publisher \": \"Official site of the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games\", \"url \": \"http://www.london2012.com/games/olympic-sports/index.php\", \"accessdate \": \"2010-09-09\", \"urlstatus \": \"dead\", \"archiveurl \": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20101125100752/http://www.london2012.com/games/olympic-sports/index.php\", \"archivedate \": \"2010-11-25\"} However, it was announced in December 2016 that the dancesport discipline of breakdancing would form part of the programme for the 2018 Summer Youth Olympics, with men's, women's and mixed-team events included in a one-on-one battle format.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://www.olympic.org/news/three-new-sports-to-join-buenos-aires-2018-yog-programme\", \"title\": \"Three new sports to join Buenos Aires 2018 YOG programme\", \"date\": \"2017-01-25\", \"accessdate\": \"2017-08-25\", \"work\": \"Olympic.org - Official website of the Olympic Movement\"}\n\nPhysical demands\nOver the years, competitive ballroom dancing has evolved so much in its choreography, requiring a higher level of athleticism. Many individuals that spectate or dance socially often underestimate the physical attributes and demands of ballroom dancing. In order to compete at a world level, elite competitive dancers undergo rigorous training to help and enhance their competition performance. These dancers seem to perform at such a high level of energy expenditure that a deeper understanding of these energy demands may help build specific training programs used to sustain a high quality dance performance consistent over a few rounds of a competition.\nIn 1988, an Australian study was conducted to determine the heart rate and estimated energy expended during ballroom dancing.{\"citetype\": \"journal\", \"date\": \"June 1988\", \"title\": \"Heart rate and estimated energy expenditure during ballroom dancing\", \"journal\": \"[[British Journal of Sports Medicine]]\", \"volume\": \"22\", \"issue\": \"2\", \"pages\": \"57\\u201360\", \"doi\": \"10.1136/bjsm.22.2.57\", \"pmc\": \"1478556\", \"pmid\": \"3167503\", \"last\": \"Blanksby\", \"first\": \"B. A.\", \"author2\": \"Reidy, P. W.\"} Professors Blanksby and Reidy of the Department of Human Movement and Recreation Studies at the University of Western had ten competitive ballroom dance couples simulate a dancesport competition, dancing their competitive routines in either the Latin American or Standard division.{\"citetype\": \"journal\", \"date\": \"June 1988\", \"title\": \"Heart rate and estimated energy expenditure during ballroom dancing\", \"journal\": \"[[British Journal of Sports Medicine]]\", \"volume\": \"22\", \"issue\": \"2\", \"pages\": \"57\\u201360\", \"doi\": \"10.1136/bjsm.22.2.57\", \"pmc\": \"1478556\", \"pmid\": \"3167503\", \"last\": \"Blanksby\", \"first\": \"B. A.\", \"author2\": \"Reidy, P. W.\"} After administrating all required laboratory tests (in order to record their height, weight, body fat percentage, fat free mass and the resting/maximal heart rate and VO2 values), the couples danced a five-dance final, given a 15 to 20 second break between each dance.{\"citetype\": \"journal\", \"date\": \"June 1988\", \"title\": \"Heart rate and estimated energy expenditure during ballroom dancing\", \"journal\": \"[[British Journal of Sports Medicine]]\", \"volume\": \"22\", \"issue\": \"2\", \"pages\": \"57\\u201360\", \"doi\": \"10.1136/bjsm.22.2.57\", \"pmc\": \"1478556\", \"pmid\": \"3167503\", \"last\": \"Blanksby\", \"first\": \"B. A.\", \"author2\": \"Reidy, P. W.\"} Throughout the final their heart rates were telemetered and recorded. The purpose of this study was to estimate the energy requirements from heart rates acquired during competition simulation and previously recorded measures of VO2 and HR.\nThe average heart rate for male dancers in Standard was 170 beats min\u22121 and 168 beats min\u22121 in the Latin American.{\"citetype\": \"journal\", \"date\": \"June 1988\", \"title\": \"Heart rate and estimated energy expenditure during ballroom dancing\", \"journal\": \"[[British Journal of Sports Medicine]]\", \"volume\": \"22\", \"issue\": \"2\", \"pages\": \"57\\u201360\", \"doi\": \"10.1136/bjsm.22.2.57\", \"pmc\": \"1478556\", \"pmid\": \"3167503\", \"last\": \"Blanksby\", \"first\": \"B.

McGraw-HilBookCo.\", \"author\": \"Astrand, P.-O. and Rodahl, K.

Generally males had a higher energy expenditure than their female counterparts.
