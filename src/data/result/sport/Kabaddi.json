The objective of the game is for a single player on offense, referred to as a \"raider\", to run into the opposing team's half of a court, tag out as many of their defenders as possible, and return to their own half of the court, all without being tackled by the defenders, and in a single breath. Points are scored tagged by the raider, while the opposing team earns a point for stopping the raider. Players are taken out of the game if they are tagged or tackled, but are brought back in for each point scored by their team from a tag or tackle.\nIt is popular in South Asia and other surrounding Asian countries. Although accounts of kabaddi appear in the histories of ancient India, the game was popularised as a competitive sport in the 20th century. It is the national sport of Bangladesh.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"title\": \"A tale of kabaddi, Bangladesh\\u2019s national sport\", \"url\": \"http://www.dhakatribune.com/sport/other-sports/2016/12/15/tale-kabaddi-bangladeshs-national-sport/\", \"work\": \"Dhaka Tribune\"}{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"chapter\": \"Kabadi\", \"chapterurl\": \"http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Kabadi\", \"title\": \"Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh\", \"first\": \"Gofran\", \"last\": \"Faroqi\"} It is the state game of the Indian states of Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Haryana, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, Odisha, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, and Uttar Pradesh.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"https://sportycious.com/introduction-kabaddi-history-rules-information-91452\", \"title\": \"Kabaddi Introduction, Rules, Information, History & Competitions\", \"last\": \"siddharth\", \"date\": \"2016-12-31\", \"website\": \"Sportycious\", \"language\": \"en-US\"}\nThere are two major disciplines of kabaddi: so-called Punjabi kabaddi, also referred to as circle style, comprises traditional forms of the sport that are played on a circular field outdoors, while the standard style, played on a rectangular court indoors, is the discipline played in major professional leagues and international competitions such as the Asian Games.\nThe game is known by numerous names in different parts of South Asia, such as: kabaddi  or chedugudu in Andhra Pradesh; kabaddi in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Kerala and Telangana; kabadi or ha-du-du in Bangladesh; bhavatik in Maldives, kauddi or kabaddi in the Punjab region; hu-tu-tu in Western India, hu-do-do in Eastern India; chadakudu in South India; kapardi in Nepal; and kabadi or sadugudu in Tamil Nadu.\n\nHistory of the game\nKabaddi originated in the ancient Tamil region, which is predominantly present-day Tamil Nadu and parts of other South Indian states. Tamil empire spread this game to South East Asia during their sea trade. The word Kabaddi might have been derived from the Tamilnadu \u201ckai-pidi\u201d (\u0b95\u0bc8\u0baa\u0bbf\u0b9f\u0bbf) meaning \u201cto hold hands\u201d.\nThere are accounts of Gautama Buddha having played the game recreationally.[citation needed]\nDespite these conflicting claims, India has been credited with having helped to popularize kabaddi as a competitive sport, with the first organized competitions occurring in the 1920s, their introduction to the programme of the Indian Olympic Games in 1938, the establishment of the All-India Kabaddi Federation in 1950, and it being played as a demonstration sport at the inaugural 1951 Asian Games in New Delhi. These developments helped to formalize the sport, which had traditionally been played in villages, for legitimate international competition.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"title\": \"The kabaddi question - whose game is it anyway?\", \"url\": \"http://www.espn.com/kabaddi/story/_/id/17854768/the-kabaddi-question-game-anyway\", \"work\": \"ESPN.com\", \"accessdate\": \"2018-08-20\"}{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"date\": \"2015-10-27\", \"title\": \"Nation at Play: A History of Sport in India\", \"url\": \"https://books.google.ca/books?id=O5mACgAAQBAJ&pg=PA219&lpg=PA219&dq=%22Vedic%22+%22kabaddi%22&source=bl&ots=a0cu-rN3Qm&sig=re-A8huBsvqMQMHiDYQ3QgDWr_A&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjAko_o4vzcAhUB74MKHVi6AUk4ChDoATAEegQIBhAB#v=onepage&q=%22Vedic%22%20%22kabaddi%22&f=false\", \"publisher\": \"Columbia University Press\", \"isbn\": \"9780231539937\", \"last\": \"Sen\", \"first\": \"Ronojoy\"}{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"title\": \"A tale of kabaddi, Bangladesh\\u2019s national sport\", \"url\": \"http://www.dhakatribune.com/sport/other-sports/2016/12/15/tale-kabaddi-bangladeshs-national-sport/\", \"work\": \"Dhaka Tribune\"}\nAfter being demonstrated again at the 1982 Asian Games in Delhi, kabaddi was added to the Asian Games' programme beginning in 1990.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"title\": \"Kabaddi goes international\", \"url\": \"https://www.dailypioneer.com/sunday-edition/sunday-pioneer/sports-feature/kabaddi-goes-international.html\", \"accessdate\": \"2018-08-23\", \"last\": \"Pioneer\"}\n\nStandard style\nIn the international team version of kabaddi, two teams of seven members each occupy opposite halves of a court of 10 by 13 metres (33\u00a0ft \u00d7\u00a043\u00a0ft) in case of men and 8 by 12 metres (26\u00a0ft \u00d7\u00a039\u00a0ft) in case of women. Each has five supplementary players held in reserve (in other words, for substitution). The game is played with 20-minute halves with a 5-minute half break in which the teams exchange sides. During each play, known as a \"raid\", a player from the attacking side, known as the \"raider\", runs into the opposing team's side of the court and attempts to tag as many of the seven defending players as possible. For a raid to be eligible for points, the raider must cross the baulk line into the defending team's territory, and then return to their half of the field without being tackled. (If an attacker touches a defender and hasn't yet reached the baulk line, they don't need to reach the baulk line to score points and may return to their half of the court.)[7] While raiding, the raider must loudly chant kabaddi, confirming to referees that their raid is done on a single breath without inhaling. A 30-second limit is also enforced on each raid.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://kabaddiikf.com/RULES_Regularikf.doc\", \"title\": \"Rules of Kabaddi\", \"publisher\": \"International Kabaddi Federation (IKF)\", \"accessdate\": \"26 August 2014\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20160304070523/http://kabaddiikf.com/RULES_Regularikf.doc\", \"archivedate\": \"4 March 2016\"}{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"2016-10-05\", \"title\": \"Kabaddi World Cup 2016: A handy guide to the format, rules and how the sport works\", \"url\": \"http://www.firstpost.com/sports/kabaddi-world-cup-2016-a-handy-guide-to-the-format-rules-and-how-the-sport-works-3034132.html\", \"work\": \"Firstpost\", \"accessdate\": \"2017-10-29\"}{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"title\": \"Kabaddi 101: Raid, defend, revive, repeat\", \"url\": \"http://www.espn.com/kabaddi/story/_/id/20169474/all-need-know-pro-kabaddi-league-2017\", \"work\": \"ESPN.com\"}{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"2016-01-30\", \"title\": \"Everything you need to know about Kabaddi\", \"url\": \"http://indianexpress.com/article/blogs/sports-blogs/everything-you-need-to-know-about-kabaddi/\", \"work\": \"The Indian Express\", \"accessdate\": \"2017-10-29\"}\nA point is scored for each defender tagged. If the raider steps beyond the bonus line marked in the defending team's territory, they earn an additional point known as a bonus point. If the raider is successfully stopped (tackled), the opposite team earns a point instead. All players tagged are taken out of the game, but one is \"revived\" for each point a team scores from a subsequent tag or tackle. Bonus points do not revive players. Players who step out of the boundary are out. A raid where no points are scored by the raider is referred to as an \"empty raid\". By contrast, a play where the raider scores three or more points is referred to as a \"super raid\". If a team gets all seven players on the opposing team out at once (\"All Out\"), they earn two additional points and the players are placed back in the game.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://kabaddiikf.com/RULES_Regularikf.doc\", \"title\": \"Rules of Kabaddi\", \"publisher\": \"International Kabaddi Federation (IKF)\", \"accessdate\": \"26 August 2014\", \"urlstatus\": \"dead\", \"archiveurl\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20160304070523/http://kabaddiikf.com/RULES_Regularikf.doc\", \"archivedate\": \"4 March 2016\"}{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"2016-10-05\", \"title\": \"Kabaddi World Cup 2016: A handy guide to the format, rules and how the sport works\", \"url\": \"http://www.firstpost.com/sports/kabaddi-world-cup-2016-a-handy-guide-to-the-format-rules-and-how-the-sport-works-3034132.html\", \"work\": \"Firstpost\", \"accessdate\": \"2017-10-29\"}{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"title\": \"Kabaddi 101: Raid, defend, revive, repeat\", \"url\": \"http://www.espn.com/kabaddi/story/_/id/20169474/all-need-know-pro-kabaddi-league-2017\", \"work\": \"ESPN.com\"}{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"2016-01-30\", \"title\": \"Everything you need to know about Kabaddi\", \"url\": \"http://indianexpress.com/article/blogs/sports-blogs/everything-you-need-to-know-about-kabaddi/\", \"work\": \"The Indian Express\", \"accessdate\": \"2017-10-29\"}\nAdditional rules are used in the Pro Kabaddi League: if a team has two empty raids in a row, the next raider must score a point, because the next raid is a \"do-or-die\" raid.

In Sanjeevani kabaddi, one player is revived against one player of the opposite team who is out. The game is played over 40 minutes with a five-minute break between halves. There are seven players on each side and the team that outs all the players on the opponent's side scores four extra points. In Gaminee style, seven players play on each side and a player put out has to remain out until all his team members are out. The team that is successful in outing all the players of the opponent's side secures a point. The game continues until five or seven such points are secured and has no fixed time duration. Amar style resembles the Sanjeevani form in the time frame rule, but a player who is declared out stays inside the court while play continues. For every player of the opposition touched \"out\", a team earns a point.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"7 March 2014\", \"title\": \"Kabaddi In India: Origins, success and current pitiable state\", \"url\": \"http://www.sportskeeda.com/kabaddi/kabaddi-india-origins-success-current-pitiable-state\", \"work\": \"Sportskeeda.com\"} Punjabi kabaddi is a variation that is played on a circular pitch of a diameter of 22 metres (72\u00a0ft).{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"title\": \"Kissa 2 Kabaddi da\", \"publisher\": \"Sarwan Singh Sangam Publications\"}\n\nInternational competitions\nThe following competitions are played in standard format, for that of circle style kabaddi, see Punjabi kabaddi.[citation needed]\n\nKabaddi World Cup\nThe Kabaddi World Cup is an outdoor international standard style kabaddi competition conducted by the International Kabaddi Federation (IKF), contested by men's and women's national teams.
