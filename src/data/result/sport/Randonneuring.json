    "content": "Randonneuring\nRandonneuring (also known as Audax in the UK, Australia and Brazil) is a long-distance cycling sport with its origins in audax cycling.  In randonneuring, riders attempt courses of 200\u00a0km or more, passing through predetermined \"controls\" (checkpoints) every few tens of kilometres.  Riders aim to complete the course within specified time limits, and receive equal recognition regardless of their finishing order.  Riders may travel in groups or alone as they wish, and are expected to be self-sufficient between controls.   A randonneuring event is called a randonn\u00e9e or brevet, and a rider who has completed a 200\u00a0km event is called a randonneur.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.rusa.org\", \"title\": \"Randonneurs USA\", \"work\": \"Randonneuring\"}{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"editor1last\": \"Krausz\", \"editor1first\": \"John\", \"last \": \"Seray\", \"first \": \"Jacques\", \"editor2last\": \"Krausz\", \"editor2first\": \"Vera van der Reis\", \"title \": \"The Bicycling Book\", \"publisher \": \"The Dial Press\", \"year \": \"1982\", \"location \": \"New York\", \"pages \": \"89\"}\nThe international governing body for randonneuring is Audax Club Parisien (ACP), which works with other randonneuring organisations worldwide through Les Randonneurs Mondiaux (RM).  Randonneuring is popular in France, and has a following in the Netherlands, Belgium, United Kingdom, Italy, Australia, United States, Canada, Brazil, Ireland, India, Japan and Malaysia.\n\nHistory\nIn the late nineteenth century Italy, day-long \"challenge\" sports became popular.  Participants aimed to cover as much distance as possible and prove themselves audax (\"audacious\").[3]  The first recorded audax cycling event took place on June 12, 1897, when twelve Italian cyclists attempted the challenge of cycling from Rome to Naples, a distance of 230 kilometres (140\u00a0mi), during daylight hours.{\"citetype\": \"journal\", \"year\": \"2010\", \"title\": \"The History of Randonneuring , Part 1: V\\u00e9locio, the Audax and Paris-Brest-Paris\", \"journal\": \"Bicycle Quarterly\", \"volume\": \"8\", \"issue\": \"3\", \"pages\": \"54\", \"last\": \"Heine\", \"first\": \"Jan\"}   Similar events became popular elsewhere, and in 1904 French journalist Henri Desgrange produced Audax regulations, which belonged to his Auto newspaper.  Under the Audax regulations, riders rode as a group.  Successful riders were awarded a certificate called a Brevet d'Audax.  A group of successful audax cyclists formed the Audax Club Parisien (ACP), which took over the organisation of Audax events on Desgrange's behalf.   In 1920, there was a disagreement between Desgrange and the ACP.  Desgrange withdrew ACP's permission to organise events under his Audax regulations, and ACP created its own allure libre (free-paced) version of the sport, where successful riders were awarded certificates called Brevets des Randonneurs.  This style is now popularly known as \"randonneuring\".\nDesgrange continued to promote the original Audax rules, and on July 14, 1921 the Union of Parisian Audax Cyclistes (UACP) was formed, which became the Union of French Audax in January 1956, and later simply Union des Audax.  The original style is still popular in France and neighbouring countries.[5]  In Great Britain where the original audax style does not exist, and in Brazil where it is not common, the term audax is used interchangeably with randonneuring, reflecting the sport's origins with Audax Club Parisien.\nRandonneuring has much in common with cyclotouring, the founding-father of which is often said to be the journalist Velocio (Paul de Vivie), also credited with making derailleur gears popular.{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"editor1last\": \"Wadley\", \"editor1first\": \"JB\", \"last \": \"Durry\", \"first \": \"J\", \"title \": \"The Guinness Guide to BICYCLING\", \"publisher \": \"Guinness Superlatives LTD\", \"location \": \"Enfield, Middlesex, England\", \"page \": \"91\"}\n\nRules and process\nThe majority of randonneuring events are classified as \"brevets des randonneurs\".{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"editor1last\": \"Wise\", \"editor1first\": \"Jennifer\", \"title \": \"Randonneurs USA Members Handbook\", \"publisher \": \"Randonneurs USA\", \"location \": \"Santa Cruz, CA, USA\", \"page \": \"10\", \"year \": \"2009\"} In such events, riders follow a course through a series of predetermined checkpoints called \"controls\"; these are typically a few tens of kilometres apart.  Each rider carries a \"brevet card\" which must be stamped at each control to prove completion.  In some events, riders will be asked to supplement this by collecting till receipts in certain places and by answering questions about their surroundings at \"information controls\", such as recording a distance from a milepost.  At the end of the event, the brevet card is handed in to the organisers who will then check and certify the results.  Riders are expected to keep within minimum and maximum average speed limits.  For a typical 200-kilometre (120\u00a0mi) brevet, the minimum speed is around 15 kilometres per hour (9.3\u00a0mph) and the maximum is 30 kilometres per hour (19\u00a0mph).  Riders who arrive early at controls will be made to wait before they can carry on. Riders can stop to eat and rest at controls, though no extra time is allowed for doing so.  Riders are free to ride individually or in groups as they wish.  A brevet is not a race, and no completion order is published.  Riders are expected to be fully self-sufficient between controls and must carry food, water, spare clothing and tools to meet their requirements.\nIn addition to brevets appearing on a calendar date, there are \"permanent\" (or \"raid\") brevets which may be ridden on any date by prior arrangement with the organiser, and \"DIY permanents\" where a rider proposes a specific route.  In these events, the \"controls\" are predesignated places where a rider will stop and collect evidence of passage such as a shop receipt.\nIn addition to 200-kilometre (120\u00a0mi) events, there are brevets of 300,\u00a0400,\u00a0600 kilometres (190,\u00a0250,\u00a0370\u00a0mi) and more.  These will typically involve an element of night-riding.  There are also shorter events: in a \"brevet populaire\" (or simply \"populaire\"), riders follow a course of 50,\u00a0100,\u00a0150 kilometres (31,\u00a062,\u00a093\u00a0mi).  These brevets are seen as a good introduction to the full-blown \"randonneur\" events, and also as a manageable distance for riders who want to maintain regular participation in the sport over a sustained period of time.\nThere are variations on the brevet theme including team events such as the \"Fl\u00e8che\" or \"Arrow\", which usually converge on a single end point from many starts, and 200 kilometres (120\u00a0mi) per day \"Dart\" events.\n\nBicycles and equipment\nRandonneuring bicycles are not subject to the UCI regulations for road-racing: a cycle is acceptable for randonneuring if it is solely human powered, uses wheels, and is no more than a metre wide.[citation needed]  Tricycles and recumbents, therefore, are allowed.\nAuthors such as Simon Doughty describe a 'typical' randonneuring bike as being somewhere between a dedicated road-racing bike and a touring bike.[8]  Such bicycles usually have lightweight steel frames, drop handlebars, relaxed (i.e. comfortable) frame geometry, medium-width tyres, triple chainsets, moderately low gearing, and the capacity to carry lightweight luggage.  Mudguards and lighting systems are also common, and may be required for some events.\nAs of 2019, modern lighting (LED & Lithium Ion batteries), paired with a dynamo hubs are more prevalent; as well as a mix between equipment designed for bikepacking (aerodynamic, lightweight); or more traditional pannier systems particularly for longer distance events.\nRandonneurs are expected to be self-sufficient between controls except in the event of real emergency.  Riders are therefore expected to carry food, water, tools, etc.  Some events specifically require riders to carry specific equipment (e.g. lights, spare bulbs, reflective clothing), though this varies depending on the organiser.\n\nFamous brevets\nThe majority of brevets are relatively small and locally organised, making for a busy calendar of events for enthusiasts.  However, there are also some particularly well-known and prestigious events which attract participants from all over the world.\n\nParis\u2013Brest\u2013Paris\nSometimes regarded as the Blue Riband randonn\u00e9e, Paris\u2013Brest\u2013Paris (PBP) is an approximately 1,200 kilometres (750\u00a0mi) event held on an out-and-back course between Paris and Brest every four years. Begun in 1891, it is the oldest bicycling event still regularly run. It began as a race for professional cyclists, but is now a non-competitive endurance challenge. To qualify, a cyclist must complete a series of brevets within the same year. The series can be completed in any order (200,\u00a0300,\u00a0400 and 600 kilometres (120,\u00a0190,\u00a0250 and 370\u00a0mi) is traditional), and any brevet may be replaced with a longer randonn\u00e9e.\nThe PBP was the first popular long distance race, initiated in 1891. After 1931 the riders were separated into three groups: professional cyclists, and two non-professional groups known as the Allure libre club and the Audax club. Allure Libre consisted of individuals riding alone in the spirit of self-sufficiency, while Audax riders rode as a group and maintained a steady pace.  As interest in long distance cycling had waned in favour of stage events like the Tour de France, the professional race part of the PBP was lost in 1951, leaving only the randonneuring part of the event.\nThe Randonneuring part of the PBP had been governed by Audax Club Parisien (ACP) since the 1930s. In 1975 the Audax and Allure libre groups split up and formed two different PBP events. Now the ACP runs the event every four years in their Allure Libre format, and the Union des Audax runs it every five years in their Audax format.\nThe most recent Paris-Brest-Paris was held in 2019 on August 18. In order to qualify for the event a randonneur needed to do a super randonee series of brevets (200,\u00a0300,\u00a0400 and 600 kilometres (120,\u00a0190,\u00a0250 and 370\u00a0mi)) in the qualifying year i.e. by July 2019.\n\nLondon\u2013Edinburgh\u2013London\nLondon\u2013Edinburgh\u2013London is a 1400\u00a0km event that takes place in the United Kingdom every four years. The event typically starts in north London, taking a route through the east of England, to Edinburgh, usually returning along the same route.\nThe event last took place in July 2017.\n\nBoston\u2013Montreal\u2013Boston\nBoston\u2013Montreal\u2013Boston (BMB) is also a 1,200 kilometres (750\u00a0mi) out-and-back between Boston and Montreal. BMB is sometimes regarded as the North American equivalent of PBP.  It was held every year except when Paris\u2013Brest\u2013Paris was held.\nOther 1000\u00a0km brevets across globe\nOther 1200\u00a0km brevets across globe\nOther 1400\u00a0km brevets across globe\nOther 1400 plus km brevets across globe\n\nAwards\nA rider who has successfully completed a 200-kilometre (120\u00a0mi) brevet is called a randonneur.  This is a lifelong title.\nRiders completing successful events receive awards, either from Audax Club Parisien or another randonneuring organisation.  Examples of these are:\n\nTime limits\nRandonneuring events must be undertaken within set time limits based on a set average speed.  There is some regional variation in these, but the following list is typical:\nOrganisers are usually free to reduce the maximum speed. This sometimes makes it easier to man controls at particularly hilly events.\nTo emphasise that Randonneuring events are not a race, many events also have a maximum speed equal to double the minimum speed (i.e. 30\u00a0km/h for a 600\u00a0km event).\n",
