The opening instrumental title piece, \"Titles\", later named \"Chariots of Fire \u2013 Titles\", was released as a single which reached No. 1 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart for one week after a five-month climb.[38] The soundtrack album was No. 1 on the Billboard 200 for four weeks and sold one million copies in the US. In March 1982, Vangelis won an Academy Award for Best Original Music Score, but refused to attend the awards ceremony[37] partly due to his fear of flying. He turned down an offer to stay in a stateroom aboard the Queen Elizabeth 2 for a boat crossing.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"21 November 1982\", \"title\": \"Mechanic of Music\", \"url\": \"http://vangeliscollector.com/telegraph112182.htm\", \"accessdate\": \"10 February 2019\", \"first\": \"Andrew\", \"last\": \"Duncan\", \"newspaper\": \"Telegraph Sunday Magazine\"} Vangelis commented that the \"main inspiration was the story itself.

It was the third such score by Vangelis as he'd previously scored documentaries about Georges Mathieu and Georges Braque. In 1982 he composed the score of Missing directed by Costa-Gavras, which was awarded the Palme d'Or and gained Vangelis a nomination for a BAFTA Award for Best Film Music.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.nemostudios.co.uk/nemo/main/vangelis/v05.htm\", \"title\": \"Nemo: Vangelis - chapter 5\", \"accessdate\": \"18 August 2016\", \"work\": \"nemostudios.co.uk\"} Other Vangelis film soundtracks produced during this time include Antarctica for the film Nankyoku Monogatari in 1983, one of the highest-grossing movies in Japan's film history,{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.nemostudios.co.uk/nemo/main/vangelis/v06.htm\", \"title\": \"Nemo: Vangelis - chapter 6\", \"accessdate\": \"18 August 2016\", \"work\": \"nemostudios.co.uk\"} and The Bounty in 1984.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.nemostudios.co.uk/nemo/main/vangelis/v07.htm\", \"title\": \"Nemo: Vangelis - chapter 7\", \"accessdate\": \"18 August 2016\", \"work\": \"nemostudios.co.uk\"} He declined an offer to score 2010: The Year We Make Contact (1984), the sequel to 2001: A Space Odyssey.[37]\nIn 1981, Vangelis collaborated with director Ridley Scott to score his science fiction film, Blade Runner (1982).[41] Critics have written that in capturing the isolation and melancholy of Harrison Ford's character, Rick Deckard, the Vangelis score is as much a part of the dystopian environment as the decaying buildings and ever-present rain.[42] The score was nominated for a BAFTA and Golden Globe award. A disagreement led to Vangelis withholding permission for his recordings to be released, so the studio hired musicians dubbed the New American Orchestra to release orchestral adaptations of the original score. After 12 years, Vangelis' own work was released in 1994 but is considered incomplete as the film contained other Vangelis compositions that were not included.[43] In 2007, a box set of the score was released to commemorate the film's 25th anniversary, containing the 1994 album, some previously unreleased music cues, and new original Vangelis material inspired by Blade Runner.[44]\nIn 1992, Paramount Pictures released the film 1492: Conquest of Paradise, also directed by Ridley Scott, as a 500th anniversary commemoration of Christopher Columbus' voyage to the New World. Vangelis's score was nominated as \"Best Original Score \u2013 Motion Picture\" at the 1993 Golden Globe awards, but was not nominated for an Academy Award.[45] However, due to its success Vangelis won an Echo Award as \"International Artist Of The Year\", and RTL Golden Lion Award for the \"Best Title Theme for a TV Film or a Series\" in 1996.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.newsfinder.org/site/more/vangelis_papathanassiou/\", \"title\": \"Vangelis Papathanassiou by Gus Leous\", \"date\": \"7 March 2003\", \"website\": \"Newsfinder.Org\", \"accessdate\": \"20 August 2016\"}\nVangelis wrote the score for the 1992 film Bitter Moon directed by Roman Polanski, and The Plague directed by Luis Puenzo.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.nemostudios.co.uk/nemo/main/vangelis/v10.htm\", \"title\": \"Nemo: Vangelis - chapter 10\", \"accessdate\": \"18 August 2016\", \"work\": \"nemostudios.co.uk\"}[47] In the 90s, Vangelis scored a number of undersea documentaries for French ecologist and filmmaker, Jacques Cousteau, one of which was shown at the Earth Summit.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.nemostudios.co.uk/nemo/main/vangelis/v10.htm\", \"title\": \"Nemo: Vangelis - chapter 10\", \"accessdate\": \"18 August 2016\", \"work\": \"nemostudios.co.uk\"}[48] The score of the film Cavafy (1996) directed by Yannis Smaragdis,{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.nemostudios.co.uk/nemo/main/vangelis/v10.htm\", \"title\": \"Nemo: Vangelis - chapter 10\", \"accessdate\": \"18 August 2016\", \"work\": \"nemostudios.co.uk\"} gained an award at the Flanders International Film Festival Ghent and Valencia International Film Festival{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.newsfinder.org/site/more/vangelis_papathanassiou/\", \"title\": \"Vangelis Papathanassiou by Gus Leous\", \"date\": \"7 March 2003\", \"website\": \"Newsfinder.Org\", \"accessdate\": \"20 August 2016\"}\n\nTheatre and stage productions\nIn the early 1980s Vangelis began composing for ballet and theatre stage plays.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.nemostudios.co.uk/nemo/main/vangelis/v06.htm\", \"title\": \"Nemo: Vangelis - chapter 6\", \"accessdate\": \"18 August 2016\", \"work\": \"nemostudios.co.uk\"} In 1983 he wrote the music for Michael Cacoyannis' staging of the Greek tragedy Elektra which was performed with Irene Papas at the open-air amphitheater at Epidavros in Greece.[37] The same year Vangelis composed his first ballet score, for a production by Wayne Eagling.

As a hobby, Vangelis enjoys painting; his first art exhibition of 70 paintings was held at Almudin in Valencia, Spain in 2003 and then toured South America until the end of 2004.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"6 January 2005\", \"title\": \"My Greek odyssey with Alexander\", \"url\": \"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/3634447/My-Greek-odyssey-with-Alexander.html\", \"accessdate\": \"18 August 2016\", \"author\": \"Peter Culshaw\", \"newspaper\": \"[[The Daily Telegraph]]\"}{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"1 July 2012\", \"title\": \"Vangelis: why Chariots of Fire's message is still important today\", \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/01/vangelis-chariots-olympic-interview\", \"accessdate\": \"18 August 2016\", \"author\": \"Allegra Donn\", \"newspaper\": \"[[The Guardian]]\"}{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.nemostudios.co.uk/nemo/main/vangelis/v14.htm\", \"title\": \"Nemo: Vangelis - chapter 14\", \"accessdate\": \"18 August 2016\", \"work\": \"nemostudios.co.uk\"}{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.vangelismovements.com/vangelispaintings.htm\", \"title\": \"Vangelis Paintings\", \"publisher\": \"Vangelis Movements\", \"accessdate\": \"6 November 2016\"}\n\nMusical style and composition\nThe musical style of Vangelis is diverse; although he primarily uses electronic music instruments, which characterize electronic music, his music has been described as a mixture of electronica,{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.udiscovermusic.com.au/rediscover-vangelis-see-you-later\", \"title\": \"Rediscover Vangelis' 'See You Later'\", \"date\": \"29 February 2016\", \"publisher\": \"uDiscover\", \"accessdate\": \"20 August 2016\"} classical (his music is often symphonic), progressive rock,{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://ambientmusicguide.com/a-z-essential-albums/vangelis/\", \"title\": \"Vangelis\", \"publisher\": \"Mike Watson aka Mike G\", \"accessdate\": \"20 August 2016\", \"author\": \"Mike G\", \"work\": \"Ambient Music Guide\"} jazz (improvisations),[19] ambient,{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://ambientmusicguide.com/a-z-essential-albums/vangelis/\", \"title\": \"Vangelis\", \"publisher\": \"Mike Watson aka Mike G\", \"accessdate\": \"20 August 2016\", \"author\": \"Mike G\", \"work\": \"Ambient Music Guide\"}{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.udiscovermusic.com.au/ambient-in-20-songs\", \"title\": \"Ambient In 20 Songs\", \"date\": \"5 May 2016\", \"publisher\": \"uDiscover\", \"accessdate\": \"20 August 2016\"} avant-garde/experimental,{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://ambientmusicguide.com/a-z-essential-albums/vangelis/\", \"title\": \"Vangelis\", \"publisher\": \"Mike Watson aka Mike G\", \"accessdate\": \"20 August 2016\", \"author\": \"Mike G\", \"work\": \"Ambient Music Guide\"}{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11110-blade-runner-trilogy-25th-anniversary/\", \"title\": \"Blade Runner Trilogy: 25th Anniversary\", \"date\": \"7 February 2008\", \"website\": \"[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]\", \"accessdate\": \"20 August 2016\", \"author\": \"Mike Orme\"} and world.[19]{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.udiscovermusic.com.au/rediscover-china\", \"title\": \"Rediscover China\", \"date\": \"30 September 2014\", \"publisher\": \"uDiscover\", \"accessdate\": \"20 August 2016\"} Vangelis is sometimes categorized as a new-age composer,{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11110-blade-runner-trilogy-25th-anniversary/\", \"title\": \"Blade Runner Trilogy: 25th Anniversary\", \"date\": \"7 February 2008\", \"website\": \"[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]\", \"accessdate\": \"20 August 2016\", \"author\": \"Mike Orme\"} a classification others have disputed.

I'm happy when I have unlimited choice; in order to do that, you need everything from simple acoustic sounds to electronic sounds.[19] Sound is sound and vibration is vibration, whether from an electronic source or an acoustic instrument.{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"1 July 2012\", \"title\": \"Vangelis: why Chariots of Fire's message is still important today\", \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/01/vangelis-chariots-olympic-interview\", \"accessdate\": \"18 August 2016\", \"author\": \"Allegra Donn\", \"newspaper\": \"[[The Guardian]]\"}Synthtopia, an electronic music review website, stated that Vangelis' music could be referred to as \"symphonic electronica\"{\"citetype\": \"book\", \"year\": \"2015\", \"title\": \"The Encyclopedia of Film Composers\", \"url\": \"https://books.google.hr/books?id=Xz99CAAAQBAJ\", \"publisher\": \"Rowman & Littlefield\", \"pages\": \"386\\u2013388\", \"isbn\": \"9781442245501\", \"author\": \"Thomas S.

The site went on to describe his music as melodic: \"drawing on the melodies of folk music, especially the Greek music of his homeland\".{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.synthtopia.com/content/2004/01/17/vangelis/\", \"title\": \"Review of Vangelis\", \"date\": \"17 January 2004\", \"website\": \"Synthtopia.com\", \"accessdate\": \"6 October 2008\"} Vangelis' music and compositions have also been described as \"...a distinctive sound with simple, repetitive yet memorable tunes against evocative rhythms and chord progressions.\"[84] His first electric instrument was a Hammond B3 organ, while first synthesizer a Korg 700 monophonic.[9] He has often used vibrato on his synthesizers, which was carried out in a distinctive way on his Yamaha CS-80 polyphonic synthesizer \u2013 varying the pressure exerted on the key to produce the expressive vibrato sound. In a 1984 interview Vangelis described the CS-80 as \"The most important synthesizer in my career \u2014 and for me the best analogue synthesizer design there has ever been.\"[9]\nIn an interview with Soundtrack, a music and film website, Vangelis talked about his compositional processes. For films, Vangelis stated that he would begin composing a score for a feature as soon as he sees a rough cut of the footage.[85] In addition to working with synthesizers and other electronic instruments, Vangelis also works with and conducts orchestras. For example, in the Oliver Stone film Alexander, Vangelis conducted an orchestra that consisted of various classical instruments including sitars, percussion, finger cymbals, harps, and duduks.[86]\nHe explains his customary method of approach. As soon as the musical idea is there, as many keyboards as possible are connected to the control-desk, which in turn are directly connected to the applicable tracks of the multi-track machine. The idea now is to play as many keyboards as possible at the same time. That way, as broad a basis as possible develops, which only needs fine-tuning. After that it's a question of adding things or leaving out things.[87]Vangelis once used digital sampling keyboard E-mu Emulator.[9] While acknowledging that computers are \"extremely helpful and amazing for a multitude of scientific areas\", he describes them as \"insufficient and slow\" for the immediate and spontaneous creation and, in terms of communication, \"the worst thing that has happened for the performing musician\".{\"citetype\": \"news\", \"date\": \"1 July 2012\", \"title\": \"Vangelis: why Chariots of Fire's message is still important today\", \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/01/vangelis-chariots-olympic-interview\", \"accessdate\": \"18 August 2016\", \"author\": \"Allegra Donn\", \"newspaper\": \"[[The Guardian]]\"}[9] He considers that the contemporary civilization is living in a cultural \"dark age\" of \"musical pollution\".
