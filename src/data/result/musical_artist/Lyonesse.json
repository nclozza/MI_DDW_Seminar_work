    "content": "Lyonesse\nLyonesse is a country in Arthurian legend, particularly in the story of Tristan and Iseult. Said to border Cornwall, it is most notable as the home of the hero Tristan, whose father was king. In later traditions, Lyonesse is said to have sunk beneath the waves some time after the Tristan stories take place, making it similar to Ys and other lost lands in medieval Celtic tales, and perhaps connecting it with the Isles of Scilly.\n\nLyonesse in Arthurian legend\nIn medieval Arthurian legend, there are no references to the sinking of Lyonesse, because the name originally referred to a still-existing place. Lyonesse is an English alteration of French L\u00e9oneis or L\u00e9onois (earlier Lo\u00f6nois), a development of Lodonesia, the Latin name for Lothian in Scotland. Continental writers of Arthurian romances were often puzzled by the internal geography of Great Britain[dubious  \u2013 discuss]; thus it is that the author of the French Prose Tristan appears to place L\u00e9onois contiguous, by land, to Cornwall. \nIn English adaptations of the French tales, L\u00e9onois, now \"Lyonesse\", becomes a kingdom wholly distinct from Lothian, and closely associated with the Cornish region, though its exact geographical location remained unspecified. The name was not attached to Cornish legends of lost coastal lands until the reign of Elizabeth I of England.{\"citetype\": \"journal\", \"date\": \"February 1953\", \"title\": \"Lyonnesse: The Evolution of a Fable\", \"journal\": \"Modern Philology\", \"volume\": \"50\", \"issue\": \"3\", \"pages\": \"162\\u2013170\", \"doi\": \"10.1086/388954\", \"last\": \"Bivar\", \"first\": \"A. D. H.\"} However, the legendary lost land between Land's End and Scilly has a distinct Cornish name: Lethowsow. This derives from the Cornish name for the Seven Stones Reef, on the reputed site of the lost land's capital and the site of the notorious wreck of the Torrey Canyon. The name means 'the milky ones', from the constant white water surrounding the reef.\nAlfred, Lord Tennyson's Arthurian epic Idylls of the King describes Lyonesse as the site of the final battle between Arthur and Mordred. One passage in particular references legends of Lyonesse as a land fated to sink beneath the ocean:\nThen rose the King and moved his host by night\nAnd ever pushed Sir Mordred, league by league,\nBack to the sunset bound of Lyonesse\u2014\nA land of old upheaven from the abyss\nBy fire, to sink into the abyss again;\nWhere fragments of forgotten peoples dwelt,\nAnd the long mountains ended in a coast\nOf ever-shifting sand, and far away\nThe phantom circle of a moaning sea.\nDeriving from a false etymology of Lyonesse, as the 'City of Lions', it was said in some later traditions to be the capital of the legendary kingdom, situated on what is today the Seven Stones Reef, some eighteen miles west of Land's End and eight miles north-east of the Isles of Scilly.[2]\n\nAnalogues in Celtic mythology\nThe legend of a sunken kingdom appears in both Cornish and Breton mythology. In Christian times it came to be viewed as a sort of Cornish Sodom and Gomorrah, an example of divine wrath provoked by unvirtuous living.\nThere is a Breton parallel in the tale of the Cit\u00e9 d'Ys or Ker Ys, similarly drowned as a result of its debauchery with a single virtuous survivor escaping on a horse, in this case King Gradlon. The Welsh equivalent to Lyonesse and Ys is Cantre'r Gwaelod, a legendary drowned kingdom in Cardigan Bay.  Not too dissimilarly, the Gaelic otherworld T\u00edr na n\u00d3g ('Land of Youth') was often conceived of as mystical place that had to be reached via a sea voyage, though it lacks an inundation myth.\nIt is often suggested that the tale of Lyonesse represents an extraordinary survival of folk memory of the flooding of the Isles of Scilly and Mount's Bay near Penzance.{\"citetype\": \"journal\", \"year\": \"1907\", \"title\": \"Days in Cornwall\", \"page\": \"163\", \"last\": \"Hind\", \"first\": \"C. Lewis.\"} For example, the Cornish name of St Michael's Mount is Karrek Loos y'n Koos - literally 'the grey rock in the wood'. Cornish people around Penzance still get occasional glimpses at extreme low water of a sunken forest in Mount's Bay, where petrified tree stumps become visible. The importance of the maintenance of this memory can be seen in that it came to be associated with the legendary Brython hero Arthur, although the date of its inundation is actually c. 2500 BC.\n",
